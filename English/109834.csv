The streets of Lion's Arch are quiet in the wake of Dragon Bash. While the festival didn't go as well as planned, Lion's Arch is still standing. You supported Dragon Bash and our fair city, so you have my thanks.

Clear skies,
Captain Magnus, Ship's Council"

The Aetherblade scoundrels have a base inside Lion's Arch! I need deputies for a raid on their hideout. Consider yourself deputized. Head to the base of the waterfall at Diverse Ledges as soon as you can.

There's a second Aetherblade lair at Broadhollow Bluffs in Gendarran Fields. It's a death trap, but it's filled with treasure. Let's give these pirates a taste of their own medicine. Plunder their lair. If we can clean them out then they'll think twice before setting up shop again.
