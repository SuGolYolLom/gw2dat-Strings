First: sincerest congratulations on bringing down Kralkatorrik. Three Elder Dragons and a god—very impressive. That merits contemplation.

Which brings me to my second point: Tyria is changing. I find myself wondering about the shape of this new world and what the future holds for the Charr. So I've invited my fellow imperators, along with their best and brightest, to our Homelands for a grand convocation. A celebration of who the Charr are—and who we might become. I've even brokered a ceasefire with remnants of Flame, believe it or not.

I've also extended an invitation to some of our allies, and it should come as no surprise that you and your guild are at the top of that list. It would be my privilege to host a "champion" of your renown. (And one of us, no less.)

After all, who else can say they have an Elder Dragon at their command?

I look forward to meeting you in the flesh. You'll find a chopper waiting at the Black Citadel.

Yours sincerely,

Bangar Ruinbringer
Imperator
