It occurred to me that you'll probably be needing to travel deeper into the desert sooner or later, and my guess is sooner.

While raptors are fine beasts, the highlands are full of steep hills, and a springer may be more useful to you. Head up to the northern hills of the Desert Highlands, and you'll find a stable there run by a girl named Unja. She can help you.

I should warn you—the way to their village is difficult. You'll need to do some training with your raptor first.

Tasa and the other villagers send their greetings.

May your travels be fruitful,
Aksim"
