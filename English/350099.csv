I hope that you are well! The neighborhood is buzzing with excitement about you! I've had word that there will be a party celebrating the charr/human peace negotiations in Queensdale. The reception will be at the Manor of Lord Caudecus, overlooking the shire of Beetletun, and will be attended by diplomats from all the major races. Captain Logan Thackeray is concerned for the safety of Queen Jennah, who will be attending, and will need support. A hero of your merit should attend the soiree and offer what help you can.
 
Thanks,

As a result of your actions, Queen Jennah has been rescued from bandits, and Minister Caudecus is her guest in Divinity's Reach while his manor is being renovated. 

However, I've also heard that those renovations have had their own problems, and that your help might be needed there again. Head to the estate and see what the problem is. I'm told you are to meet with a Shining Blade member named Talie. I'm sure it won't be dangerous at all.

I have no idea what this secret might be, but it appears to be worth killing over. I'm getting reports that terrified sylvari are streaming out of the arbor with stories of bloodshed and horror. There's a handful of sylvari who are caring for the refugees dislodged by the Nightmare Court invasion, but something more must be done. 

I've already volunteered your assistance, so go and be a hero and end this brutality.

Safe travels,

"89";"Hail, mighty hero!

The stories of your accomplishments have spread far and wide. I have heard from Caithe, who is looking for help in the Twilight Arbor, a nest of Nightmare Court followers north of the Grove. My understanding is that she is going there because another of the Sylvari firstborn, Faolain, has established herself as the Nightmare Court leader, and she feels it is her responsibility. Caithe has always been a loner, first after losing Faolain to the Court and later with the breakup of Destiny's Edge, and I think she is trying to mobilize some new friends against her former oldest ally.

As always,

"91";"Congratulations on defeating Kudu. I have to admit, hearing that Kudu was working with draconic energies made me wonder what he's really up to.

That said, there are more pressing problems. With Kudu gone, things have gotten worse in Sorrow's Embrace. The dredge are lurching toward civil war, and some of Kudu's krewe are still active in the depths. Stranger still, there's a couple of dredge splinter groups who appear to be requesting help from the outside world.

I never thought I'd see those xenophobic tunnel dwellers ask for aid, but this could be an opportunity to make friends. At the very least, you'll get to keep tabs on the dredge. Plus, there's a chance to clean up any Inquest remnants who are still in Sorrow's Embrace. Sounds like something right up your alley.

I've heard from Caithe again. She is disappointed that she has been unable to reconcile Logan and Rytlock, but has reunited with Eir Stegalkin. The two are heading into Sorrow's Embrace which used to be the dwarven foundries of Sorrow's Furnace. Those caverns are now occupied by the dredge, who were once the slaves of the dwarves. Reports have said that Zojja is already there, pursuing her own agenda. I don't know what she is after, only that she is going in with spells blazing. Caithe would appreciate whatever aid you can give them.

Flame Legion factions are now conspiring to unify their forces to assault the beleaguered Pact soldiers who are holding the zealots in check. There are also dark rumors (are there any other kind?) that the Flame Legion is desperate to turn the tide, and when zealots get desperate, they become dangerous.

Return to the Citadel of Flame immediately and make sure the Flame Legion doesn't burn down Tyria. You'll want to locate Commander Suma. He's the officer in charge of the Pact forces inside the citadel.

Go now,

We have received news on the northeastern battlefront: Gaheron Baelfire, the leader of the renegade Flame Legion charr, has been driven back to the gates of his headquarters at the Citadel of Flame. A combined military force effort of the Vigil, Durmand Priory, and Order of Whispers are even now struggling to breach that gate. 

Both Logan Thackeray and Rytlock Brimstone have been dispatched to that front, and given the way they feel about each other, I think they'll need someone to keep them from killing each other. Naturally I thought of you, though I don't know what's the greater danger—Gaheron or the two former allies.

Thanks,

The kodan sanctuary ship, Honor of the Waves, is still threat from the Sons of Svanir. Honor's Claw, the war leader of these Kodan, has asked for help. 

It seems all I do these days is send you into harm's way. That said, this one's worth the risk. Help the kodan. They've been though enough already.

I don't know how to tell you this, but I am afraid that Eir Stegalkin has been in a dark mood of late. Apparently her recent meeting with Zojja had affected her badly, and I (and others) are afraid that she plans to do something rash, to "go out as a hero". I have heard this from Caithe, who has been following the norn northwards into Frostgorge Sound. There, a great sanctuary ship of the kodan, the Honor of the Waves, is floundering, as a result of the attacks of Jormag's minions. Both Caithe and I fear that Eir is looking for a battle too big for herself, and I said that you would catch up with them to help Eir.

Please attend to this at your earliest convenience,

But I've just learned the Pact has reason to believe the Inquest laboratory has become unstable. Even worse, the dispatched Agent Spire is unaware of the danger she's in.

Because of your history with the location, the Pact thinks you're the ideal candidate to re-enter the Crucible, find Agent Spire, and let her know about this development. Do whatever is necessary to close that Inquest site forever and keep Spire safe from harm.

Good luck,

Word has reached me that Rytlock and Logan have been spotted together, and not threatening each other. Whatever you did at the Citadel of Flame, it seems to have taken.

 Zojja has been in pursuit of her master's other apprentice, Kudu, since she drove him out of Sorrow's Embrace. Kudu has set up a great laboratory in the heart of the expansive Inquest base at the Crucible of Eternity, in the eastern part of the Steamspur Mountains. 

Kudu has been continuing his experiments in draconic energy, and I have no doubt that Zojja intends to confront him, alone if she has to. I have sent word to Rytlock and Logan, but don't know if they will arrive in time. Can you help?

I cannot contain my delight over the death of Zhaitan! All of Tyria recognizes your valor and bravery, and is heartened by the reuniting of Destiny's Edge!
 
The death of Zhaitan does not mean the end of the war against the Elder Dragons, for they and the corruption they have spread continue to daunt our land. In the north, the Sons of Svanir, followers of Jormag, seek to plunder the sinking remains of the Honor of the Waves. In the south, the Inquest's experiments in draconic energies at the Crucible of Eternity are unstable, and the entire complex threatens to explode. And in the shadow of Zhaitan's corpse, his surviving minions harry our investigators, who seek to unlock the secrets of the Elder Dragons.

The Pact forces have launched an airborne assault on Zhaitan himself, in his lair in the former city of the human gods, Arah.
