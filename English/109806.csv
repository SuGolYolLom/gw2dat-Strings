"14";"Halloween draws near. The insanity is rising, so be on the alert for changes all over Tyria. The Durmand Priory is scrambling to respond to reports of increasing paranormal activity in Queensdale, Kessex Hills, and Gendarran Fields. People have seen Lunatic Courtiers in Kryta for the first time in over two centuries, so excitement abounds! 

The Priory has set up camps in Queensdale, Metrica Province, the Plains of Ashford, Caledon Forest, and Wayfarer Foothills to use as bases of operations to respond to the lunacy. They're keeping an eye on suspicious individuals who have shown up around the festivities there and are taking people away to play dangerous games.

Magister Tassi's search for Mad King Thorn's history is causing folks to travel farther abroad as six additional ghosts appear to tell their tales. Other Priory scholars are upset by rumors of people visiting the Mad Realm. Could it be that the Mad King's demesne has opened its doors?

"16";"Ding-a-ling! The Mad King was seen busting out of the lion statue in Lion's Arch! The statue lies in ruin, and there's a mad portal in its place. Enter at your own risk. 

There's no longer any doubt that the Mad King really does exist, and the Durmand Priory believes he's trying to break out into Tyria. Their projections for what will happen if he succeeds are apocalyptic. Word is spreading quickly that, in his current state of power and rage, the Mad King must not be allowed to leave his realm!

"18";"The Mad King has been reined in! His power diminished, the Prince of Puns seems to have been limited to the terms of his ancient curse: he can only visit Lion's Arch once a year, on Halloween—and only just for fun. The portal to the Mad Realm in Lion's Arch has been capped, and we're safe to celebrate the spirit of Halloween. Join in on the Mad King's Halloween games, and you may by surprised by his generosity.

If you haven't carved every pumpkin in Tyria yet, now's your chance. Talk to a master carver, located in Lion's Arch and the Durmand Priory's Halloween response camps in Queensdale, Metrica Province, the Plains of Ashford, Caledon Forest, and Wayfarer Foothills, to find out whether you're a master carver too. 

Magister Tassi has been pleased that so many have hunted down the ghosts from the Mad King's past, but if you haven't found all twelve, then you're missing critical pieces of King Oswald Thorn's infamous history!

May the sweetness you mine from candy corn nodes sustain you all year long! Happy Halloween!
