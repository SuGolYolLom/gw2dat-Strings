I'm asking friends to meet me in Lornar's Pass, where Scarlet's dropped some new type of twisted monstrosity from one of her portals. Local Priory observers are convinced that she's planning to set off a doomsday weapon in their remote end of the Shiverpeaks. They say she's recalling her twisted watchwork troops from all over Tyria to power her weapon test, and I say that we need to shut it down before a lot of innocents get killed. 

One more thing. You know those mysterious probe devices that have been found all over Tyria? I've heard that the Vigil are looking into three of those discovered only recently in Bloodtide Coast. These are dangerous times, and I'm sure those Vigil crusaders would appreciate your help reaching the investigation sites.
