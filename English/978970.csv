Destiny's Edge was a guild of legend, and it saddens me to hear they no longer wish to be together. However, I have heard through my sources that Eir Stegalkin has made a bee-line for the Catacombs beneath old Ascalon. I don't know why she is going to that haunted ruin, as it is swamped with human ghosts, victims of the Foefire. More importantly, the Catacombs are in the heart of Ashford, which is now Charr territory, and Rytlock will not be happy with this particular norn tromping through his territory.
