I have attached a recipe for our latest invention: an ectoplasmic matrix infused within a vision crystal that allows its user to view apparitions and ghostly entities invisible to the naked eye. 

We are calling it the Infused Crystal, or "I-C" for short. (Our krewe is actively fielding snappier names and is open to suggestions, but I honestly doubt we'll find anything better than that.)

Please construct the I-C at your earliest convenience and test it at the locations described. These places have shown elevated spectral levels. You won't have to do much; just use the crystal and wander around recording anything abnormal you may find.

Thank you for your time, patience, and soon-to-be-ectoplasmically-infused oculars,

Traskk
