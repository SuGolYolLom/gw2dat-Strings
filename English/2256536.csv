"We don't normally allow outsiders within our walls," Makoto said, enveloping her tiny asura lover in her feathered arms, "So you'll have to swear not to tell anyone what you see here."

Prapp gazed in awe at the wonders around him. "What happens if I slip up," he thought. He had a hypothesis, of course, but a city built entirely of candy—why, there were several papers' worth of innovations here!

Makoto chuckled, entirely mirthlessly. "I'll have to kill you, of course."

Though we regretably lack the Tome of the Rubicon, we do not need it to seize what we need. Prophecy is a farce. We decide our future.

The Stone Summit will never yield! We do not need a "blessing" given, nor will we pay its price. Strength is taken, not granted.

My movements are labored, though I am slowly acclimating. The stone surrounds me, but I am strong. I feel no fear.

With each phase, transformation can be felt within. Though we grudgingly accept our new bodies, we are bound for irreversible change. All has not been to plan, however. Some among us have not withstood the treatment. Their bodies were melted from within by fire, leaving behind nothing but ash. We mourn them, but their wills were perhaps not strong enough for the rites. The ritual priests propose the fallen may have been overwhelmed by a force connected to or perhaps superior to what we're harnessing. A being of pure and ancient fire.

Regardless, the Stone Summit will not yield. We are the masters of our lands and all within them."

Melonni, Dunkoro, Talkora. Koss has had many loves in his life, but something was always missing. He'd always needed...more. Here, finally, was the solution.

After all: Who could ever be MORE than Koss?

Koss gazed longingly into the eyes of his doppelganger, who gazed back with equal affection. The completion each had sought, found. For Koss—an equal. For the doppelganger—a target more worthy than any other.

As Koss embraced Koss, their love shifted beyond reality. It defied dimensions. And their journey together was just beginning."
"107";"Progress is slow. We've harnessed the mountain's thermal springs for our furnaces, but we lack slave-cores for the Forged Colossus. The ice beasts assault our gates nightly, tearing them asunder, but their ranks seem to never thin no matter how many we fend off.

The transformation is accelerating. The stone is now at my neck, and I feel the call to join the fight with our brethren. But I will resist—we will ALL resist. There is only one Summit.

The scholars claim to understand enough about its magic to harness it, either to undo the Rite of the Great Dwarf or perhaps to leverage it. We could transform into something never before seen on the face of Tyria. We could also die.

We have made our peace with death, and would welcome it over the life that the Deldrimor would have for us."
