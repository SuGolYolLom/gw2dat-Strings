Your accomplishments are well known by the movers and shakers in society, such that it is widely regarded that you are ready to face the toughest enemies that threaten us. As reports come in from around Tyria, we will notify you via mail of the current threats. Our cartographers will continuously update the world map with the locations of these trouble spots with a red portal marked "Raid." Inside these areas are myriad dangers that will require all the cunning, tactics, and strategy you can muster. When you're ready, head to one of these locations and speak with an informant. I caution you. You should rally a full squad to tackle these dangers, else you'll risk total failure.

Sincerely,

Your Herald"
