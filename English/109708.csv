I heard about your troubles with the Pact's mortar company. I know you're still agonizing over the soldiers who died under your guns, but the important thing is that you exposed the spy that was fouling up the Pact's cohesion... which was obviously her goal.
Destiny's Edge is still trying to pull itself together, but at the moment I fear it's a lost cause. We've got the physical and magical skills it takes to be effective, but there's too much anger and bitterness for us to function effectively as a team anymore. As Countess Anise says, I'm hoping for the best but preparing for things to get much worse before they get any better.

I heard about Tonn the demolitions expert. I know you're still agonizing over the loss of your partner, and nothing I say will make things any easier, but you have to press on. I wish I could be more comforting, but the truth is, the war is far from over and a lot more innocents and heroes are going to die before we cleanse Tyria of the dragons.

Bad news about the Pact's mortar company. I suppose it's cold comfort to remind you that friendly fire incidents are commonplace during wartime. Probably won't do any good to tell your Pact superiors that, either, but it's true.
The important thing is that you got the mesmer who was making all that trouble for you and your army.
Destiny's Edge is still trying to make a go of it, but they're trying without me for now. I've had enough of childish accusations. I'd rather work with soldiers who understand their role, and the stakes.

I heard about the lethal mix-up with the mortar company. I'm glad you put down the mesmer—those illusion-casting imbeciles can be real trouble, especially when you're trying to organize a lot of people for the same purpose.
Try not to let it ruin the rest of your war, and keep up the good work.
I think Eir is plotting something to smooth things over between me and her, or me and the rest of Destiny's edge. I may see what she's got in mind, just for a laugh. I'll let you know how it goes.

I continue to be impressed with your progress—word just reached the Grove about your order's successful effort to recruit the hylek. I've always been interested in their advanced alchemical knowledge, and now that they've joined our cause, I look forward to learning more of it. I'm also reliably told that hylek are among the fiercest fighters on Tyria—it will be good to have them with us against the dragons.
It is a shame that their village was destroyed, but at this stage I firmly believe lives are more important than property. When the dragons are defeated, we'll turn our attention to rebuilding, but first things first.
I'm also doing my part to marshal resistance to the dragons. I still intend to smooth things over between the members of Destiny's Edge and reforge us into the great fighting machine we once were, but it's a slow, difficult process that is complicated by the strong personalities, egos, and neuroses involved. I won't give up, though, and neither should you.
May the Pale Tree guide you,
