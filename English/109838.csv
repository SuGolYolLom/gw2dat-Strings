You've received this pamphlet at your request for information on the almighty Order of Om.

There are few things more daring than drinking the deadly-sweet juice of raw omnomberries. Its infamy is indisputable. And so, we, the masters of our craft, have banded together to spread the word of our choicest of games: Belcher's Bluff.

The rules are simple:
- Rounds occur every five seconds.
- Participants perform one action per round.
- Actions are limited to: drinking omnomberry juice, drinking water, bluffing, or belching.
- If the participant does not drink juice, the opposer's belch is bolstered.
- Belched-on bluffers cannot bluff for two rounds.
- Belchers cannot belch again until three drinks—juice or water—are consumed.
- Water can only be consumed after three other actions.
- Advanced drinkers can use Signature Moves once per match.

Our order is comprised of six masters, each a keeper of a coveted Signature Move. Should you defeat them, their secrets will be yours! If you think yourself ready, see the attached list for the masters' locations.

May your mug be ever full,
