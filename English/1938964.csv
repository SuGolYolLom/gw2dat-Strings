"25";"For nearly one hundred years following our flight, we lived the lives we had so often dreamed of, free of persecution by the Flame Legion.

As we traveled south and built the society that would one day be called Olmakhan, we were forced to question many of the age-old norms of charr society. We were starting from nothing, and in a foreign, hostile landscape no less. To survive, there would need to be changes.

There would be no sense of superiority over the land. This was the core dictum of the Olmakhan: peace with nature, so that we might thrive beyond mere survival. Only a thorough understanding of our new environment would allow us to remain here, to build villages, farms, and families.

For nearly one hundred years we strove to achieve this ideal. It was then that nature sent us our first true test of resolve: a cataclysm beyond our northern horizon that shook the seafloor, and the Great Flood that made an archipelago of our new homeland.

In single moment, it seemed that all we'd built was lost. Many of our tribe were claimed by nature that day, but none truly despaired. Our culture had been forged in struggle and tempered by hardship, and our commitment to our Olmakhan family shone like steel in the sun once the waters receded. We rebuilt, and we thrived again.

Recent times have brought hints of a troubled, larger world that threatens to wash away our peace. First came the spread of the cruel little ones across these islands, with their stone and crystal wonders that defy gravity and their unnatural creations brought to life with unfamiliar magics. 

Then came the great iron sky-whale, breathing smog and flame as it crashed into the soft sands of our shoreline. Its metal shell protects our elder council as they meet to plan our response to the threat of the Inquest, and we've begun to fortify our structures with its iron skeleton.

Nature has presented us with new challenges, and if we must adapt to survive these trials, we will."

Of course they pandered to me. They acknowledged that we've successfully confirmed that Kralkatorrik's lieutenants are able to Brand the dead, likely due to Kralkatorrik having absorbed Zhaitan's magic. But then they dared complain that we're generating too much waste and costing too much in cadaver requisitions. They're "puzzled" why we need further testing at this point.

The reasons are obvious: You can never have too much data. I'm confident reason will win out. This lab is simply too important to shut down."

"210";"The story of the Olmakhan begins with the charr of old, for there was once a time when we were no different. The first Olmakhan were not born into our family, but instead chose it for themselves.

Our first benefactors and elders were born and raised as all charr are: to parents uncaring, a fahrar unbending, a warband unyielding. Raised to fight, to kill, to win. But even these savage souls knew kinship to one another, loyalty beyond oneself, and an appreciation for the good of the many over the individual. It was the warband that mattered, not any one soldier. In fact, to be without a warband—the closest thing they knew to a family—was to know shameful isolation.

For the earliest of those who would be Olmakhan, the Flame Legion ruled over Blood, Iron, and Ash. They were ruthless beyond comprehension, driven by an insatiable lust for power over all living things. 

It was Flame Legion will that prevented mothers and daughters of the charr from taking up arms or practicing magic, for the shamans rightly feared they would be their downfall. Even though these mothers and daughters could control the sky itself, they were shunned by the Flame Legion as inferior to the fathers and sons on the battlefield. Bathea Havocbringer, martyr to all sensible charr, was the first to see through their lies. She would certainly not be the last. 

For many generations, there was an imbalance in charr society. The Flame Legion would blame the humans, but to any with eyes it was clear that our people had become their own worst enemy. In the absence of humanity, the charr would continue to fight. Their entire worldview was constructed around domination and warfare. There would always be another foe, always another enemy to overcome, until they were at each others' throats and none were left alive.

For years, our benefactors despaired. How would we escape from this endless cycle of death and destruction?

Then the stories began to spread. Stories of rebellion.

Pyre Fierceshot was a name long whispered in hushed tones, for fear the Flame Legion's ears might hear it. He had worked with the humans to save our world, to stop the Flame Legion's false gods from destroying all we held dear.

Blood, Ash, and Iron began to draw closer to one another. An alliance was finally beginning to take shape, but the suspicions of the past were not easily overcome. Hesitation bred complacency in the ranks, and the Flame Legion found them easy prey. 

For many years, we would hear of revolution. We would hear that the battle for freedom was coming. For a time, there would be a flicker of hope. Then the Flame Legion would gather their forces and destroy it.

It was in this time of great unease, when it seemed the Flame Legion's influence would burn away all remaining hope, that we began to hear the words of Kalla Scorchrazor, grandcub of the famed Fierceshot.

Within her words were the very ideas the Flame Legion sought to purge. Freedom for the mothers and daughters of the charr. An alliance between Blood, Ash, and Iron. Only through the destruction of the old ways could our kind ever be free.

Some charr took this as a sign to stand and fight. But our forebears had seen this again and again. Fighting begets fights, violence begets violence. The cycle anew.

And so, those who would one day become Olmakhan fled the ancestral charr lands. They fled from Ascalon. They fled from the legions. They fled from the Flame."
