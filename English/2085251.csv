It is a rather common delusion that we built the city of Ahdashim. However, I have never been nor will be a common djinn, for I possess not only the attunement of air, but also an infinite intellect and a voracious appetite for academia.

Many of my years have been consumed by our shared history in my quest for the secrets of our world. So, for your benefit and mine, I have scribed this 565th edition historical tome detailing the rise of the Original Four and their connection with the lifeblood of Ahdashim.

We have always been bound to Ahdashim. Long before we harnessed it, Ahdashim suckled from the ley line upon which it perched. For years, the city bent the elements to its will and thus protected the natural world from all tyranny and evil.

Until, that is, four of our most powerful ancestors discovered a way to channel it themselves. After converging with the ley line, the Original Four displayed ethereal elementalism to become the first guardians...the Cardinals of Ahdashim.

While my ancestors delved into the earth for supremacy, my years buried in our scriptures have  granted me something far more wondrous."
