I'm pleased to invite you to Rata Sum for the grand unveiling of my wondrous new invention: the Super Adventure Box! A multitude of marvels awaits you inside my Box, where you can take part in cutting-edge, experiential education!

By the way, if you should happen upon any unusual chests around Tyria on your way to our capital city, I'd make it worth your while to deal with the escaped sprites hiding within them. Bring any baubles you recover from those glitchy projections to me, and I will reward you with super coins! This extra-special offer is extremely short-term. I urge you to take advantage of it today.

We made it to Hoelbrak in mostly one piece, so that's good. The Vigil are here, and they're starting to figure out what's going on with the dredge and Flame Legion. Looks like they're hearing about the crazy weapons the dredge and Flame Legion made together. I've never seen dredge so powerful.

Anyway, I'll let you know when I find out where they're holed up so we can track them down. I hope you still want to come with me. So, may Wolf have your back.

"89";"%str1%, it wouldn't have been right for me not to thank you for the hatchery. Especially since it was a warband test—one I was sure to fail without your support. I still can't believe they're letting me try out for their warband. This was the first stage of my trials, which means I owe you double thanks, really.

In other news, I've been talking to a few Vigil representatives, and they tell me they're closing in on the location of the Molten headquarters. Soon as they find out, they'll tell me, and I'll tell you. You haven't changed your mind about going on that mission with me, have you? I hope not. Stay sharp!

"91";"You're as tactful as ever, %str1%. The Molten Alliance has scattered—they're disorganized and panicking and won't bother us again any time soon. Unfortunately, we still have no viable theories as to why the two forces coalesced. I'll continue to examine the subject from Rata Sum. In the meantime, you should use this respite to rejuvenate yourself at the celebratory bonfires. It's your efforts in the field that demoralized the invaders.

The only thing worth considering now is why the cowards joined forces in the first place. I plan to review the issue. You, on the other hand, have earned yourself a sabbatical at the victory bonfires. Use the time wisely. Things get awfully eventful awfully fast these days.

My next task is to find out what caused those two forces to unite. While I'm investigating the matter, I encourage you to rest and warm yourself at the celebration bonfires. This battle was hard-fought, and your contributions have earned you the right to a little relaxation.
