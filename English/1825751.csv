This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expand our knowledge of the most infamous king of Kryta and how he affected the course of history.<br><br>However, I must relate some unsettling news to you. While we initially believed this volume to be a complete account of his life, factors indicate that there are stories yet untold.<br><br>Do you see the inscription on the book? How it hints at an incomplete second volume? Perhaps there is more to be discovered—stories from the Mad King's reign that have not yet been properly collected. Please, if there is any way you can research this, I'd be glad to append your already magnificent volume!<br><br>—Magister Tassi"
