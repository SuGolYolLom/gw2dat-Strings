I'm writing to inform you that, at the behest of the Pale Tree, I will be attending the summit you are arranging to discuss Mordremoth. I'm deeply curious to discover what the world leaders will say about the idea of combining efforts. I know we could use the additional firepower. With it, maybe we'll lose fewer people than we did when we fought Zhaitan.

I foresee that my presence will cause a bit of a stir and that the attendees will want a report on the Pact's plans. If you could meet with me in the Grove, prior to the gathering, I will fill you in so you can relay the information to the attendees. If you manage to convince the leaders to work together, it will be an enormous victory. 

I look forward to seeing you again. I have some things to tell you about the Pact and our plans for Mordremoth.
