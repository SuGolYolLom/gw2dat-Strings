When Jormag threatened to bury the norn in a hellscape of ice and frost, the norn turned to their spirits: Wolf. Bear. Raven. Snow Leopard. The norn do not credit their survival to themselves, but to these Spirits of the Wild.

In this updated compendium, renowned norn historian Thyrie Bylund explores the fascinating relationship between the norn and their spirits. Through a combination of written firsthand accounts and oral histories, Bylund discovers the very real effect these spirits have on the norn and all who live alongside them."

Kormir, Goddess of Order, Spirit, and Truth, began her rise to godhood as a decorated Spearmarshal. Even in life, she sought to bring order from chaos, leading the charge against criminals and corsairs who threatened the lives of the innocent.

In this exciting collection, Kormir's loyal Sunspear compatriots speak of her mortal years, how she survived her confrontation with the Hunger, the grand battle against the fallen god, Abaddon, and her ultimate ascension to the pantheon."
