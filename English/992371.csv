"112";"Greetings,

It's unfortunate I am not contacting you with good news. We have received several reports of Mordrem moving outward from the Heart of Maguuma and appearing in areas around Tyria. It is imperative that we do everything possible to prevent Mordremoth from creating footholds close to our major cities.

I have included information on areas to investigate. Please be wary. We have detected a lot of underground activity in Brisban Wildlands, Kessex Hills, and Diessa Plateau. Gather your friends and do all you can to beat the elder dragon's minions back.

Best of luck,

—Mordrem Researcher Eullo of the Durmand Priory"
