"103";"The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that Scarlet's actions aren't as random as they seem. There's a pattern here, something she's working toward, and we need to figure it out.

I called in every favor I had with the Priory, and they're sending us the evidence they collected around Scarlet's crimes so far. They're shipping it all to the Dead End bar so we can start piecing it together. Get here as soon as you can. We need you if we're going to finally get some answers.

"105";"Kiel's been pushing to build up the air defenses around Lion's Arch, but the rest of the Captain's Council won't get on board. They say Scarlet isn't their problem—that she wouldn't strike the Arch again so soon after Dragon Bash, or that they've already withstood one of her attacks and don't need additional resources to withstand another.

They're wrong on all counts, but there's no more time to convince them. We know Lion's Arch is Scarlet's next target. We have to be prepared for whatever she has in store...especially since the city government won't be.

I've sent word to Rox and Braham, and they'll be ready to make a stand when Scarlet strikes. So will I, as will Kasmeer... Although after the Tower of Nightmares, I'm not exactly eager to expose her to that kind of danger again, no matter how exhilarating she finds it.

We'll all be waiting when you're ready. Also, let me say again how critical your help was in puzzling this whole mess out. If you ever want to consider a career change, you'd make an excellent detective.

I'd like you to confer with Sheriff Siriam in Fort Marriner about the breakout to see if there's anything we can use to track down Mai and figure out what she's doing for Scarlet. Good luck, and thanks.
