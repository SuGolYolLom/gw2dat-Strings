"24";"FOR COMMANDER'S EYES ONLY.

We have seen a sustained instability in the flow of magic across our region since Balthazar's defeat at Kodash. Although Aurene and the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik surely consumed most of the energies released by Balthazar's death, that event strained a magical ecosystem already on the brink of collapse.

The works of demons, the fall of gods, and the movement of dragons devastated our ancient land. Spirits of pilgrim and king alike wander these desert sands as ghosts. Rifts were torn in the fabric of reality for entities to step back and forth between our world and the next. A lich king corrupted and subjugated our people with necromantic magic on a continental scale.

We broke with the Order of Whispers and took to the shadows to confront these threats to our homeland, but your Pact has disrupted the cosmic machinery that regulates arcane power across the entire world. Before we knew that you had succeeded in downing two Elder Dragons, we began to see upheaval in the magical ecosystem of Elona.

Ley lines already flooded by draconic feedback will be unable to absorb the environmental impact of Balthazar's magical fallout. The situation is dire, yet we find ourselves with limited options for dealing with the spillover of Balthazar's volatile magic.

So, we reach out to you—the chosen champion of Glint's second scion. We believe your bond with Aurene could make you uniquely able to reclaim concentrations of volatile magic. Once mastered, you may even find that your resonant affinity will allow you to repurpose the volatile magic you accumulate.

Recovered volatile magic could grant you an ephemeral boost in speed, or it might restore your endurance. You may manifest other new abilities that we can scarcely imagine. Together with Aurene, you could realize Glint's vision and reverse the damage done to our magical ecology."

Speak to the on-site gardener to pick which seeds you want to grow. To plant your seeds, equip the appropriate seed pouches from your inventory, then interact with a patch of open soil. The crops you plant will regrow each day until you change the type of crop that's planted in each area. Your gardener will have several seeds available to start, but you can unlock more varieties by harvesting seeds from plants in the wild.

Your gardener can answer any questions you have in more detail. Good luck, and happy gardening.
