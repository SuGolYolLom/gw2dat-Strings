Rumor has it you've uncovered a way to harvest unbound magic, which is an invaluable resource that I would love to get my hands on. Who knows, it may even help us get underway! If you have any to spare, come see me on the airship bridge, and I'll make it worth your while.

I've been working on some aerial combat tactics that all the loose magic in the area might actually make feasible, but I'll need unbound magic to complete my prototype.
