Until now.

Follow our beloved and revered savior, Palawa Joko, as he continues his grand work throughout this broken world, bringing order from turmoil and freedom to those oppressed!

Read in awe as he singlehandedly battles the mechanical monstrosity known as the Iron Forgeman, humiliating the cowardly Stone Summit once and for all. 

Will Joko succeed? Could the great and eternal Palawa Joko fail? To write as such would be blasphemy, but one can never know the truth without reading this fascinating tale!"
