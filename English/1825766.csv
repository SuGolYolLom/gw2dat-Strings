"20";"When the Great Destroyer threatened to turn its ire on the free peoples of Tyria, no single race stood alone in the conflict that followed, and no single asuran challenged the evil of this tragic era more so than Vekk.

Follow his journey in this comprehensive volume, from his beginnings as a simple elementalist to the indelible legacy he left as one of Tyria's greatest heroes.

Praise for "The Genius of Vekk":

"Combining written accounts from the era along with the most recent historical findings, this incredible biography covers everything from Vekk's knowledge of Scrying Pools to the emergence of asura gates in Tyria. I came away astounded at the depth and detail presented, andI  would recommend this biography to anyone with an interest in the period."
