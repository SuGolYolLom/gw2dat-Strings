"36";"My friend, 
Congratulations on your recent accolades as the "Hero of Shaemoor." I'm a researcher for the Queen's archives, and I have recently uncovered some information regarding your parents. I thought you might want to see it. I would prefer to discuss the details in person, so if you will meet me at the palace gardens at Divinity's Reach, I'll share them with you. 
To prove I am what I say, I have enclosed half of an amulet, which I believe will match a broken one you've owned since you were born—something my research led me to uncover. I look forward to meeting you face-to-face.
Sincerely,
A Friend."
