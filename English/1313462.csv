When Lion's Arch was destroyed, the Black Lion Trading Company was fortunate enough to save one of their most precious treasures: the famous Black Lion's Reserve. Once a year, Evon Gnashblade opens the vaults and sends out small casks of this reserve to small breweries across Tyria. The aged, rich, full-bodied brew has slight coffee, vanilla, and pecan flavors with a caramel finish that is not overly bitter and not overly sweet. Enjoy this rare masterpiece. 

Good health and a glass for your thirst,

Sometimes, amazing brew recipes are lost to time. Sometimes they're also rediscovered.

With great fortune, adventurers rediscovered a long-lost recipe from Ashford Abbey, allowing Eldvin Monastery to resurrect this brew. The monastery brewers re-created this amazing taste of the past with a twist of their own. Eldvin Abbey Ale possesses a deep brown color and a unique taste of spices that wonderfully accent the overall flavor. 

Good health and a glass for your thirst,
