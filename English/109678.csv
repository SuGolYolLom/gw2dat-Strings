"22";"Valiant,
I continue to be impressed with your progress—word just reached the Grove about your order's successful effort to recruit the skritt. I've always been interested in the collective intelligence they display. If they are as cunning as I've heard, it will be good to have them with us against the dragons.
It is a shame that their village was destroyed, but at this stage I firmly believe lives are more important than property. When the dragons are defeated, we'll turn our attention to rebuilding, but first things first.
I'm also doing my part to marshal resistance to the dragons. I still intend to smooth things over between the members of Destiny's Edge and reforge us into the great fighting machine we once were, but it's a slow, difficult process that is complicated by the strong personalities, egos, and neuroses involved. I won't give up, though, and neither should you.
May the Pale Tree guide you,
—Caithe"
