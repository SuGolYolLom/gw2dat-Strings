They're still trying to wedge their way in, but now that I see how difficult we can make it for them, I doubt they'll keep at it much longer. Thank you.

Finally, I have something resembling peace of mind. My missing scouts are returned to me, and the danger of the mine-riddled shipwrecks is not quite as threatening. This beach is much safer thanks to you. It may not seem like it, but you've made a big difference.

Word has reached me about your accomplishments in Sparkfly Fen. You're proving yourself a brave and resourceful ally. Please take care as you continue your travels. The world gets progressively more dangerous by the moment. Your work is keeping us all a little safer.

May you continue to fare well.
