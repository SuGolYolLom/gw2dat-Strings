"456";"Greetings, Commander Landon! 

I hear you're searching for the Legate Minister's daughter, Demmi. How lucky you are that we found her before the dangers of the wilderness did! Unfortunately, of course, getting her to our lovely safe pirate camp was very expensive, but I'm certain a wealthy man like Minister Caudecus can spare a platinum or fifty. Make it a hundred, actually. For a dainty little thing, she sure can drink a lot of rum.

I'm sure you, and your master, will find that perfectly reasonable...and far better than bringing home a dead daughter, wouldn't you say?

Cordially yours, 
Captain Jayne of the Jackdaws"
