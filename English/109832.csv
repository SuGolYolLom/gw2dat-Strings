"13";"Greetings,

Our research is progressing well, thanks to the assistance of a certain %str2% (you). We have come close before , but I feel we are on the verge of real breakthrough this time. When our perfume "Asuralations" is released, your name shall be credited under "Other".

Now if only I can figure out where my brother Wark has disappeared to?

There have been whispers floating around the camp of your deeds. You've proven your movements are as soft as a shadow, as swift as a breeze, as smooth as a cub's belly fur, as sassy as a Blood Legionnaire's tail, as...well, I think you get the idea.

Of course, I'll tell the rest of the soldiers you learned it from the best first.
