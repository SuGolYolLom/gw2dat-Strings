"29";"%str1%,

I find myself at the center of a developing situation here in Divinity's Reach, following the attack at the Crown Pavilion by the sylvari villain Scarlet. Though she fortunately missed Queen Jennah, her intended target, Scarlet has taken some of my fellow emissaries and other innocents captive and has sealed them up with her in the wreckage of the pavilion.

In order to get someone in there to free those hostages and bring Scarlet to justice, I need to reverse-engineer the technology she's using to teleport her twisted puppets in and out of her lair. I plan to labor in my makeshift lab to duplicate one of Scarlet's portals, and as you come highly recommended, I'm enclosing this apparatus for remote holographic communication in hopes that you can help with my fieldwork. Come find me here in Divinity's Reach if you have any questions."

"32";"Well, well, well. You've certainly earned my attention, %str1%. Oh yes. 

I've decided to make a special side project out of you. We're going to be seeing more of each other in the future. So much more.

Since you took the time to tick me off, I can't wait to take you apart and see what makes you tick.

Tick-tock-tick. Talk to you later!
