I am sending this missive as I've been wounded in action and am slowly succumbing to my injuries. I have to tell you: years ago, my warband and I found a strange treasure in the ruins of the Grendich Courthouse. We couldn't divide it up, so we struck a deal: the last to survive would inherit the whole thing. As it happens, I am the last survivor. However, as my life is coming to an end, I am leaving it to you. We broke the key to the treasure room in half and hid the pieces in separate locations. Look for a chest submerged within Windrock Maze: its combination is hidden on the walls of the maze. The second half of the key is in Lamia Mire—follow the old-fashioned trail markers we left on the trees. If you find the treasure, it's yours. Think of it as my legacy. Live well. Be strong.
