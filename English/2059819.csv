I hope you are doing well, my friends. I myself am thriving at the Mystic Forge, thanks of course to my foresight in recruiting you to stand before that bag of wind, Qadim. 

I've received word he's entered our home city of Ahdashim. But all my attempts to communicate with the city have since been blocked. I would seek out the monster myself, but the Forge requires my attention. And my exile has not been lifted (a minor bureaucratic oversight, I'm sure...).

There is great power within Ahdashim—power that Qadim might seek to take for himself. I implore you to head to the city in my stead. If anyone knows what's going on there, it'll be the Key of Ahdashim. Seek the Key and the cardinals. Keep Ahdashim safe.

XOXO,

Zommoros"

"161";"That the Elder Dragons have a deep and intimate link with Tyria itself is indisputable at this point. Primordus arose out of magma and returned to it; Jormag froze, flooded, and shifted the earth itself; Mordremoth became one with a jungle; and so on and so forth. They eat magic and are composed of it.

But how dragons are made, and where they come from, remains a mystery. I postulate a self-ordering logic to magic that brings forth dragons when the conditions are correct. Perhaps some earthshaking event tips disorder into order, and raw, wild magic into sinew and scale.

I must wonder, however: Is our world a dragon endlessly being born?"
