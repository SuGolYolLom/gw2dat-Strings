Had it been allowed to fall...I don't want to think of the impact it would have on morale. If you wish to keep helping the war effort, I would ask that you continue south. Overlord's Greatcamp is the primary centaur stronghold and we have had little luck breaking it, but with your assistance we could gain some ground. 

Best of luck.
