There's been a marked increase in creatures escaping the Realm of the Dead. Their behavior is mostly that of typical Underworld creatures—vile, murderous, and pretty uninteresting—but according to experts in necromancy, some of them seem to be targeting priests of Grenth. Creatures from Grenth's realm attacking Grenth's followers... Fascinating, right? And terrifying!
