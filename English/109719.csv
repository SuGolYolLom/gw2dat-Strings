By the four great Spirits, but your legend grows like a young wolf! The rumors in Lion's Arch say that you and Trahearne fought against the dragon's minions, and that you single-handedly wrestled the Plaguebringer to the ground. The city celebrates your victory, the like of which I have not seen since my days as a gladiator! And Orr, they say, is your next goal—Orr, and the dragon. I am truly proud, my friend. You have come so far from our days in the Shiverpeaks.

Caithe came to speak with me at my campfire last night. She says that Zojja is headed into danger. That little asura's stubborn mind will be her end, mark my words. Caithe is convinced that we must help her. I pondered this, but in the end agreed—I must show my respect for Snaff. I must do as he would wish, and that means keeping Zojja alive even if she is foolish. Saving Zojja from whatever trouble she's found will be a glorious adventure. Your victory inspires me!

I will write to you again, soon, and tell you how this story ends.
