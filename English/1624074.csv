I hope all is well with you. Big update from the Well Kingdom of Winslow: I've recently amassed a new court. Before you ask, yes, they are rats. They're not the most talkative bunch, but they don't talk back to their regent, and that's what counts. That garden never worked out, so I've moved my efforts over to armoring. The Kingdom of Winslow endures.
