I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to write to you because I want you to understand just how much you helped us down here. The wall we're building is a much-needed barrier.

I suspect the undead are causing problems throughout many lands, not only our own. It pains me to think of what trouble they may be causing for other people.

Against our own trouble, though, you have been very helpful. With the markers repaired, my family can feel safe. The guards, too, owe you a debt. Please accept my gratitude.

Superbly done.
