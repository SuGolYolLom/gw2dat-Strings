It's been some time, hasn't it? Remember me? It's Blaine! From the well! 

Things are going great for me down here. Not only did I stay safe in the White Mantle attack, but I'm making quite a life for myself in the well. Even adopted a pet rat! His name is Nibbles. He'll warm up to me soon, I just know it.

Best regards,
—B
PS: I go by Blaine now. Figure its more appropriate for a man of my age."
