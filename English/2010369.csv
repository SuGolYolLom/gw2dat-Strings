Author's Note: After the success of Koss on Koss, my publisher talked me into writing a sequel. Who am I to refuse? Keep in mind: work in progress.

First Day, 1094 AE

Today I begin a new chapter of my afterlife. At long last, Palawa Joko is dead—and I'm free to leave the prison I've made for myself.

But as I emerge from that infernal cave for the first time in centuries, I find myself hesitating. So many years have passed—the world I left behind has moved on without me. What if there's no longer a place for an old warrior like me?

No, I can't think that way. There will always be a need for Koss. I need to focus on helping those who need it, and on rebuilding the Sunspears.

And my family. Melonni, my children. Tahlkora. I have to find out what happened to them. This is my new purpose."
