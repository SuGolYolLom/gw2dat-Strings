You've made quite a name for yourself around Butcher's Block. In fact, among some, your name is now synonymous with meat. And that's a high honor, indeed.

Your efforts in aiding our attempts to regain control of the vineyards outside Smokestead Village were an inspiration to those of us who were beginning to weary of the seemingly endless conflict. 

Because of your help, we now feel safe enough to continue our search for an answer to the ghost problem that afflicts this area. When we succeed, I will make certain that your part in the victory is well known.

I continue to be impressed with your progress—word just reached the Grove about your order's successful effort to recruit the quaggan. I've always been interested in the warrior's rage these pacifists exhibit when they fight, and now that they've joined our cause, I look forward to seeing it in person. If they are as fierce as I've heard, it will be good to have them with us against the dragons.
It is a shame that their village was destroyed, but at this stage I firmly believe lives are more important than property. When the dragons are defeated, we'll turn our attention to rebuilding, but first things first.
I'm also doing my part to marshal resistance to the dragons. I still intend to smooth things over between the members of Destiny's Edge and reforge us into the great fighting machine we once were, but it's a slow, difficult process that is complicated by the strong personalities, egos, and neuroses involved. I won't give up, though, and neither should you.
May the Pale Tree guide you,
