Hi!

My name is Kemar. Naja told us all the new books in our library are because of you. My friends and I like the books very much. My friend Elio always said he didn't even like to read, but he likes the one about Koss. He already read it three times, and he can say all the words by heart without even looking!

Thank you for helping us!

From: Kemar"
