Don't dwell on losing the quaggan village—homes can be rebuilt. The important thing is that you saved lives and secured their help.
As for me, I'm heading to our old friend Caudecus's estate to support Queen Jennah as she meets with the charr ambassador. There's a chance Zojja may be there, but I don't expect a joyful Destiny's Edge reunion. In fact, I'll be lucky if she doesn't punch me in the knees.
Keep up the good work,

I've been watching your progress since you left to join your order, and I continue to be impressed. Nice work recruiting the quaggan—blubbery, soft-headed babble-mouths can be problematic (remind me to tell you about the one I know named Logan), but it sounds like you handled it with aplomb.
Don't let losing their village weigh you down. If it weren't for you, they wouldn't be alive and so having a home wouldn't matter. At least this way there's enough of them left to rebuild.
I'm about to walk into what could be an exciting new development, but it could also be a total waste of my time. Logan (the aforementioned babblemouth) may be there, as it involves Krytan royalty. I just hope I can keep him from making a skritt smorgasbord of the entire thing.
Keep up the good work,
