You will be happy to know that my research is proceeding apace, thanks in no small part to your recent timely assistance.

I am certain that the Flame Legion would have moved in and occupied this territory, strengthening their tenuous hold on the region. Thanks to the efforts of you and the others, the lake will now remain in legion hands.

The wrecking yard has fallen into a sad state lately, but it is vital to supplying the Iron Legion with enough metal to feed into the smelter. Without those raw materials, they couldn't continue to produce the war machinery we need for victory.

I wanted to let you know how grateful the Durmand Priory and I are for your assistance at Ghostsummit. Before you arrived and lent a welcome hand, we were having little success with fighting off the harpies, who were impeding our ability to continue our research along the wall. 

As you may know, the Durmand Priory has been gathering ancient Ascalonian artifacts with the hopes that they might reveal something about the nature of the ghosts we are forced to perpetually battle. Because of your assistance in this effort, we are now a little closer to that goal.

While no victory over the ghosts is ever permanent, the respite made possible by your efforts will give us time to recover and regroup. You should also know that some of the Ascalonian artifacts we recovered show promise in helping us to understand the nature of the ghosts. 

Hopefully, this insight will lead to a turn in the tide of battle.

Although the Flame Legion came at us with wave after wave of vicious attacks, you stood your ground and thinned their ranks. I can't remember the last time I witnessed such valor under fire from a soldier. I only wish you could have stayed on to join our ranks.

I daresay the Flame Legion will think twice before launching their next assault on us.
