Thanks again for your work in a difficult situation. You helped the soldiers here to remember that they can't win the new war if they cling to the fears and prejudices of old wars already won. Now, we can set our sights on the real enemy.

You know where to find me.

I'm with Eir, Caithe, and Zojja at Camp Resolve in the Silverwastes, and they're driving me nuts. Caithe can't sit still for five minutes, and Zojja has an opinion on everything. Eir, well, she's gone all silent on us.

So what are you waiting for? Come join us. Troops are gathering here for the coming assault on Mordremoth. It's been too long since we fought an Elder Dragon together.

Looking forward to seeing you, my friend.

But I doubt even the queen could have guessed that this kind of aid would come from someone like you. Someone who, without living here, recognized what harm could come with neglecting such delicate social issues. I believe strongly that good works should be rewarded, and so I hope you accept this small compensation on behalf of the Fallen Angels.
