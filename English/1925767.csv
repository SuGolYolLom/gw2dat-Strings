RE: Internal Review

Traditionally, our organization has dealt with the unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information with a tried and true system of employing pain techniques and/or expungement. Data shows these are effective deterrents, but there is always room for improvement.

As a supplemental approach, the Internal Security Directorate recommends a pilot messaging campaign designed to reinforce the administration as a benevolent force. Note, the campaign would not require actual benevolent treatment, only the messaging of such.

Focus-group testing suggests adding the following to public addresses: "Keep up the good work! And remember: we care!""

RE: Simulation Request

Due to the uptick in equipment-replacement costs, the budget committee has required an assessment of losses. Apparently a primary factor is rain damage to environment sampling sensors resulting from Olmakhan stormcalling.

So far the committee is adhering to security's recommendation that we avoid unnecessarily inciting the local fauna. Still, I think we should run a simulation to test how effectively we can resolve the Olmakhan problem with a full-scale response from the automated quarantine system.

NOTE: Don't forget to clear the simulation plans out of the system afterward. If the committee won't be swayed, we don't want it triggered by accident in an emergency protocol or power surge."

The excellent progress of our ancillary labs on Kralkatorrik's abilities has sparked a round of suggestions for further research. Formal proposals will be forthcoming, but consider this memo the first in a series of informal introductions to suggestions we've received from all of you.

Our first proposal: Develop varied environmental enclosures for studying the effects of habitat on Kralkatorrik's minions.

Pros: Inventive. Plausible; the fact that pre-Branded species have habitat preferences suggests the Branded may also show differential responses to environment.

Cons: Minor cases of sweat rash from the prototype jungle environment.

Look for another proposal next week!"

That's fine. Don't need the network to write notes. In no particular order:

Remember to fire Bragg. Third time he's corrected me in front of a supervisor.

More subjects requisitioned from Vabbi and beyond. Was asked to research dietary habits for long-term internment. Reassigned yesterday—subjects not living long enough to matter.

Once again proposed plan to introduce ourselves to nearby native population. Could be presented as mutually beneficial. We get subjects for our pathogen experiments, they get some old technology we'd be throwing away anyway. Chance of them understanding our work is nil.

Reminds me—don't attend any more pathogen experiments just before lunch. Disgusting."
