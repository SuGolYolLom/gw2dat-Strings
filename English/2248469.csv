CHAPTER 1

Deep in the Maguuma Jungle, the world had just been saved. Mordremoth had fallen...in love. 

Yes, friends, it's the truth: it was not swords that ended the war. For while the Pact commander had conquered the dragon's mind, Lord Faren had conquered the dragon's heart.

"No one can know that you still live," Faren said, a single tear flowing down his cheek. "They wouldn't believe in you the way I do."

"I know, my shining knight." The Elder Dragon whispered back. "And yet, you must leave my side. For you have other lives to save...and more love to give.""

A pause. You should be flattered, you know. But once again, the meeting he called was strictly professional. Your heart sinks as the silence stretches on, unable to say what you really want.

But then the commander moves close. "I've also noticed the way you look at me." You can feel his warmth. "The way you've always looked at me."

"So now," the commander continues, taking your hand, "I'd like to propose...a different pact. A lifelong pact. With you."
