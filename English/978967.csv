Tales of your recent deeds have reached as far as Hoelbrak, and the servants of your Order speak highly of the many things you have done. Already you prove that my faith in you is well-placed. 

As for myself, I have been traveling. I've been investigating the legend of a powerful sword, the match to Rytlock's, that may yet exist within the catacombs of Ascalon. Zojja still fights for Snaff's legacy, while Caithe roams the Caledon Forest, keeping her own counsel. I hear Logan's returned to Kryta. I suppose I should not be surprised. He fears for his Queen's safety, and rightly so. There are many who seek to destroy the treaty between the charr and the humans. We must stop them if we are to succeed in saving Tyria from the dragons.

You are doing well, Slayer. Continue on your path, and you will hear from me again very soon.
