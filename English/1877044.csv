Congratulations on handling the Fahranur incident. My intelligence suggests you did indeed slow Palawa Joko's invasion, though his incursions into Tyria continue and he's doubtless working to accelerate them. Be assured my organization stands ready to assist in stopping him.

In that spirit, the Order of Shadows may also be able to shed light on some of the information Taimi has uncovered in her investigations at Fahranur, particularly her conclusion that Joko has gained control of another asura gate hub. Meet me at the Lifeblood Waterhole and I'll share some details with you.

Decimus the Historian takes up his pen once more in this stunning essay on the events that have shaped our world, both figuratively and quite literally. As the guilds expanded and cultural revolutions pushed the races of Tyria closer together, our world shifted to one of modernity and prosperity.

But as the Elder Dragons woke and unnatural cataclysms tore open the flesh of the world, the face of Tyria was forever altered, and new conflicts threaten it in ways heretofore unseen. Humanity is in decline, the balance of power shifting. Only through careful examination of the past can we hope to change our future."

Perhaps you've heard of my relationship with corsairs throughout Elona, and the sacrifices I've had to make to keep their swords from our throats. Perhaps you've heard of how my father disowned me for joining the Sunspears. Perhaps you've heard of my adventures with the Tyrian hero and the final fall of Abaddon.

Or perhaps you've heard none of these things. Regardless of where you stand, I assure you that this autobiography is the final word on my life, and the only side of my story worth believing."

A mere child of ten at the onset of the charr invasion, Gwen spent the better part of a decade enslaved to Ascalon's bestial conquerors. From her failed first escape attempt to her ultimate victory over the charr in the freeing of revolutionary Pyre Fierceshot, Captain Thackeray's incredible life has been the subject of fierce debate and detailed historical research.

To the people of her homeland, she is and forever will be known as a true Hero of Ascalon. Yet to her enemies, hushed whispers speak of a terrifying foe known by a more ominous title: Goremonger.

Read along as our team of experts delves into the fascinating history of this larger-than-life hero of humanity!"
