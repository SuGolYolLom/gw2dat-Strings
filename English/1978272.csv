Djinnspit is the most popular vintage of wine in Elona. I take issue with thatâ€”not simply because it's a subpar wine manufactured by soulless husks of vintners who care more for money than the art of wine making. Quite simply, it's deceptive marketing.

When it comes to proper Elonian wine, there are numerous alternatives to the run-of-the-mill Djinnspit (hereafter referred to as "common swill").

A few years ago, some foolhardy adventurer tossed down four bottles of Seborhin 1071, a delightful and most unfortunately rare vintage with hints of jammy, but not overpowering, blackberry, anise, vanilla, and just the subtlest touch of licorice. However, that is not my favorite.

No, my favorite is, most surprisingly, something I'd consider a throwaway: Jackspruce Jacaranda. It is not made with jacaranda, of course, but seems to be a grape blend taken from all across the Crystal Oasis. The label is drawn with a most endearing style (showing a jacaranda summoning a lightning bolt into a wine glass), but it is the flavor combination that is most memorable, with a strong and ever-changing floral aroma that evokes the feeling of flying over the Crystal Oasis's most beautiful locales.

My wine collection has grown to a most absurd size, but due to the...UNIQUE conditions that exist within my realm, wine never seems to spoil. Therefore, it would seem I have plenty of time to sample the others to see where they fall in my ever-expanding list of favorites.

"18";"While I rarely leave the confines of my domain, I possess the finest and most robust collection of trinkets from around the world. Adventurers travel across Tyria, finding items of all sorts from locations multifarious, and toss them into my forge in the hopes of receiving something better in return.

Most of the time, the skritt handle the method of compensation. I have to imagine that's working out just fine, considering I've yet to receive any complaints that I've read.

Still, I admit that this system is not entirely perfect. For example, the wizard Isgarren came to my forge long ago seeking special compounds that I imagine were used for some magical purpose or another. I heard of this after the fact, and was most curious what one of his stature might want to get out of my collection! But upon closer investigation, I realized with a hint of despair that there was no record of what exactly Isgarren tossed into my forge, nor what he received in return, as the skritt are rather poor at maintaining proper documentation.

Also, their handwriting is quite terrible.

This has resulted in a much more robust plan to eventually implement a system that will record all of the items entering and exiting the forge. We've yet to put the plan into action, of course, as I like to give myself lots of time to stew over new ideas for the Mystic Forge operation before putting them in place. It's been a while, admittedly, but great ideas take time to perfect, and I have a lot of great ideas.

I maintain hope that someday that curious wizard will return with need of my services. Should the situation arise, I plan to inquire at length about the nature of his work and just where he has been all this time. But, until then, all I can do is have Miyani keep an ear to the ground. It has been a very long time since Isgarren has been seen or heard from, so I have my concerns."
