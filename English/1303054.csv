Spring is just around the corner, and the Eldvin Monastery has begun preparations for another brewing season. This month's Pale Tree Pilsner was inspired by the Pale Tree herself. This brew is a light, crystal-clear brew, perfect for springtime. The hops provide a perfect balance with the other robust flavors found in this brew.
