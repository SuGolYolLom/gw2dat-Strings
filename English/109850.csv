"154";"Faolain has been driven from Twilight Arbor, but in her absence terrifying new threats have moved in.
Several Nightmare Courtiers have stormed the forest in Twilight Arbor to gain control of a secret lying somewhere among the trees. If any of them find what they're looking for, they will pose a serious danger to the surrounding communities.
Also, Aetherblade pirates have begun to convert the site into a new base of operations. I'm not sure what their goal is, but they're still following the orders of the mad villain Scarlet Briar, so whatever they're up to it can't be good.
I'm getting reports of terrified sylvari streaming out of the arbor with stories of bloodshed and horror. A handful of noble souls are caring for these refugees, but something more must be done. 
The Lionguard is mustering a strike force to shut down the Aetherblades, and a sylvari agent is preparing to confront the Nightmare Court. Both are looking for volunteers, so I thought of you. Head for Twilight Arbor, pick your target, and put an end to the brutality.
Safe travels,

We received a message from one of our contacts. It included a note personally addressed to you, and we agreed that his words eloquently express our own opinion. I'm passing it on to you. You can read it below.

"As an adventurer, you are able to come and go at your will. In your travels across the Fields of Ruin, you chose to stop and help those in need, even though they are different from you and their struggles are alien to yours. Your acts exemplify the heart of the treaty we're working toward—that we can accomplish more together than we can just serving our own ends. Thank you." —Wade Samuelsson, Commander of Ebonhawke
