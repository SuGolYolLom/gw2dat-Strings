We'd like to thank you for supporting the Black Lion Trading Company by purchasing our "How To Dance: Volume 1" novelty item.

Thanks to our asuran researchers, we're happy to announce you can now perform your new dances whenever you want—no bundle required! Using a method called "slash commands," you can now recall dances—no matter how intricate they may be—at any time. Just recite the command and let your body run wild. You'll be dancing like a pro in no time!

Saying the following slash commands out loud will cause you to immediately burst into dance:

Dodge Step: /step
Inventory Shuffle: /shuffle
Gear Grind: /geargrind

Note: The Black Lion Trading Company is not liable for any harm incurred while dancing. Please dance responsibly.

Happy dancing!
The Black Lion Trading Company"
