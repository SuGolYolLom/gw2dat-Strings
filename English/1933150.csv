Unfortunately, it looks like the specimens aren't showing any special intellectual capacity. I wasn't the only one expecting positive results due to the Balthazar energy absorbed by Kralkatorrik.

A note: I'm starting to worry about housing the Branded specimens here. It's not just that they're extremely aggressive. I think there's strategy involved in their behavior. The other day, it really seemed like they were trying to trick me into leaving my notes in their lockup—notes that include the codes to the locks. Am I being paranoid?

A thought: maybe we should be testing their strategic/tactical capacities rather than their intellect?"

In the lull after we shut down Fahranur, Rytlock and I began to worry that Joko's invasion attempts may be the first step in a larger plan. We've decided to quietly begin investigating for any intel that might shed light on his future intentions. Rytlock is focusing his efforts on Istan, while I have been reaching out to various parties here in Amnoon.

By the way, Rytlock tells me our corsair friend, Sayida the Sly, used all that bounty money to get her hands on an airship. That may come in handy—assuming she sees an opportunity to enhance her reputation or wealth, of course.

Please do get in touch if you need us.
