"13";"Hi there...again! Look at me, writing another letter. First off, thanks again for helping out at my camp. I'm glad you're such a helpful person, because I need your help again now that you've got a skimmer to help you get around.

I've attached a note to this letter. Take it to Ebele, please. It contains information on Forged and Awakened troop movements. We've used it to keep our food shipments safe. Hopefully, Ebele can use it for her exiles.

We all need to survive out here, and we have common enemies. The more we can do to help each other, the stronger we'll all be.
