We've hit a dead end here at the Durmand Priory. We'd like to interview the resident dragon expert, but he has retreated to a secure location deep within the Priory. Unfortunately, they change the access cipher to that room on a regular basis, and no one here knows the latest one.

Remember the young explorer named Campbell from Fort Salma? Magister Makkay believes she has the current cipher, and she's doing fieldwork in the Silverwastes. Could you look into retrieving the cipher for us? 

To convince her to give you the cipher, repeat this phrase: "Long live the king of Deldrimor."

I am writing to update you on events in the Grove, as I'm sure you're worried for our mother. She is still with us, though she remains unable to communicate. We believe she has retreated to the Dream to heal, much as we incubate there prior to our awakenings. We continue to give her the best possible care. I will inform you of any developments. Try not to worry too much. 

I also thought you'd want to know that a representative from each of the summit guests has been in touch to let us know they have not forgotten their pledges. They say they've begun implementing plans to research the Elder Dragons and to investigate the possibility of a unified military response. It is my understanding that they have continued to communicate with each other on this as well. Bravo, %str1%. Your words have changed the course of history. You honor us all with your great deeds.

We're planning our assault on Mordremoth at Camp Resolve, our new staging area in the Silverwastes. The time has come for all to stand and deliver, and I would like you to assist with our preparations here. I have a specific mission for you, if you're game.

The Seraph of Kryta have secured a new route to our staging area through Fort Vandal. Evidence suggests the bandits hastily abandoned the location recently. The guards posted there may know more. Please journey safely. The increased Mordrem activity is making travel especially dangerous.

I'm sending a young explorer named Campbell to investigate the strange activities at Fort Salma. I know you were at the battle that claimed the lives of so many Seraph. All my other explorers are tied up with missions or preparing to leave with the Pact. I need someone I can trust to ensure Campbell's safety. Will you return to Fort Salma and meet her there? 

Your efforts on my behalf are appreciated.

Since our rediscovery of the Silverwastes, the Society has been interested in studying the unique physiology of its hardiest...flora. I've sent you an extraction tool that makes the removal of floral organs easier. We're willing to trade you bandit crests in exchange for these Mordrem—er, plant—parts.

The fragile nature of floral organs means only the toughest specimens yield viable samples, so the plants must be of considerable strength and stature. I hear there's an underground chamber filled with such creatures in the Silverwastes. Use the extraction device I sent you when you're ready to fight one, and bring me the parts you extract.

Happy harvesting!
