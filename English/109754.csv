If you were not a hero before, you certainly are now! Lion's Arch is in an uproar, celebrating your victory and this new "pact" between the Orders. By the Six, you have truly shown your mettle! I knew you would be a star in the heavens, but even I did not think you would rise so soon. Well done, my friend, extremely well done.

Since I have left Kryta, I become more and more certain this was the right thing to do. So many other parts of the world are worse off than our kingdom. It is disheartening. I hear that Zojja and Eir are headed toward Dredgehaunt Cliffs (for what reason, I can't guess). In the spirit of your victory and unification of the three Orders, I've decided to set upon a journey that seems long overdue—to find Rytlock, and offer him the hand of friendship. The High Legions are once more under attack from an old enemy, the Flame Legion. Perhaps that will convince him that he still needs an old friend.

Even as far away as the Black Citadel, the drums of your victory are sounding. You reclaimed a fortress from the dragon—and more, used your might to force the Orders into a pact of alliance. Bravely done. 

At home, we fare less well. Interrogated captives from the Flame Legion report that their Imperator, Gaheron Baelfire, is building a mighty weapon in the fire-mountains north of Ascalon. They do not know its nature, but say that when he is done, Gaheron will be powerful enough to rival even the human gods. Whatever this weapon may be, if it is so powerful, it could be used to destroy Zhaitan and Orr. Once I have more information, I will head into the Flame Legion lands and seize it for the High Legions. No matter the cost.

There are rumors of Zojja and Eir. Zojja hunts another of Snaff's apprentices, someone named 'Kudu,' at a southern Inquest base. More asura planning to blow up the world, I assume. If that snippet Zojja is involved...they just might manage it. Be strong, fight bravely, and I will contact you when I know more.
