I'd like to congratulate you again on your defeat of Palawa Joko. But it seems your work is not yet complete. The factions formerly associated with Joko—his loyalists, the Mordant Crescent, and the Awakened—are scrambling to fill the empty seat he left behind. Tensions are rising, and I fear we may be approaching civil war unless we act quickly.

I've invited the faction leaders to a summit at the Fortress of Jahai, in northern Kourna. As the one who freed us from Joko's oppression, I'd like you to attend. You can reach the fortress via southeastern Vabbi.

I've also sent word to Taimi and Braham. They'll meet you there and escort you to the summit. With any luck, we can stop this war before it begins.

Best,
Zaeim"
