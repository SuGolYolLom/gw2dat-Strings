I've been poking around that smoking crater (formerly known as the Maguuma Bloodstone) and gathering data. Strange creatures and pockets of unbound magic have transformed the landscape into a destructive mess. But I've made an interesting discovery among the rubble that I want to discuss with you.

Meet me at the designated location at your earliest inconvenience. (No, that's not a typo.) Don't be long!
