I have to thank you. You just won me a hundred platinum from an old college friend. After I heard that Claw Island had been overrun, I bet them that you'd be the one to solve the problem and break all the dragon's toys. It's easy to be proud of you when I also get to rub it into the Arcane Council's faces. Ha!

Combining the Orders was a stroke of genius. I don't know how you did it, but your efficient use of available resources deserves another award. Speaking of awardsâ€”it's come to my attention that another of my Master's apprentices has been causing trouble up near Sorrow's Embrace. Kudu never had two sparks to rub between his ears, and now he's claiming to have invented the biggest golem in history? I'll believe it when I blow it up.

Keep up the good work,

Zojja"
