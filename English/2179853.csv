"34";"I can feel Raven's presence so strongly here in Bjora Marches. Like he's fighting Jormag and the Sons of Svanir's stranglehold on the region. He wants to help. I don't think it's a coincidence Almorra and I discovered these ancient Raven lenses in Darkrime Delves right around the time the fraenir arrived.

I don't know how or when these lenses were created, but it's clear they're very old. Several centuries, at least. They seem to react to the Raven shrines scattered around the wilds, revealing passageways and providing protection from the cold. The other day, the lens I was carrying even showed me an echo from the recent past, involving a norn patrol. I think it was teaching me how to use it.

I have theories about these lenses I'll never be able to prove. The things it can do—protect, teach, reveal—lead me to believe Raven bestowed them on our ancestors to defend against attackers. Maybe even Jormag specifically. I think that's why they're making an appearance again now. Raven wants us to fight back. To take down the fraenir and free the region. And as long as we have Almorra, I know we can do it."

"92";"Everything I've done, I've done for my people. The Spirits of the Wild saw that. It's why they sent me their aid. Why they helped me slay Frostfang. It wasn't my hand that dealt the killing blow. It was the hands of a thousand fallen norn who inspired and guided me. I did it for them, and for those who still remain.

I brought the battle to Jormag for my people. Fought for days on end and cracked a fang straight from the dragon's mouth. And when I was nearing the limit of my strength, instead of dealing the killing blow, Jormag stepped back and spoke. And for my people, I listened.

I didn't expect the voice of an Elder Dragon to be so warm. So caring. Like the voice of Bear or Snow Leopard. The voice told me that of all the creatures in this world, I was worthy of its kindness. That it saw how much I cared for the norn, and it was going to let me live. It said I had a great burden, and a choice to make.

I could return with more warriors. Continue the fight, and watch them all die. Jormag didn't want to eliminate my people, the voice said, but a dragon will always kill to survive.

Or, I could return to my village with the fang. Present it as proof a dragon can be harmed. And then lead them south, to safety. Jormag wouldn't follow, the voice said. Jormag sees, now, that the norn are special. That we must be preserved.

What Jormag doesn't realize is that norn will always fight. If my people knew what Jormag said, they would return with swords and arrows and fire. We're too proud to make deals with dragons.

So I need to hide the truth. Never tell them about the voice that feels like home. About what it said to me. Jormag is right: if we keep fighting, we'll be wiped from existence. I have to lie. For my people.

I'm doing the right thing. I'm giving the norn a future. Why does it feel as though I gave up? As though I could've won, if only I'd pushed through the pain and exhaustion?

The voice spoke true. I'll carry this burden for as long as I live. I only hope whoever takes it up when I'm gone can handle the weight of it."

I ended a life today. A Vigil patrol. Norn. I don't know why I did it, but it felt wonderful. The whispering friend told me I was doing so well. And as the light drained from his eyes, my stomach growled. My body acted without thinking, and before I knew it, he was gone. I'm vile.

What am I becoming? Is it a trick of the light on the snow, or do my claws grow longer? Why does the hunger gnaw away even now, after I did this horrible thing? What's wrong with me? Koda, help me."
