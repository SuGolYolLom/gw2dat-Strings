"4";"We haven't seen someone with your strength around here for ages. You may be able to give Vollym a run for his money. Don't tell anyone I said this, but he spends more time spectating and drinking than fighting anymore. Doesn't mean he's not a challenge—that man has the strength of Bear and ferocity of Leopard. It's just that he may not be completely invincible, as he once was. Either way, thank you for helping take care of the battle pit. I hope you learned a thing or two from your training.
