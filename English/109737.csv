"18";"Dear %str1%, 

We've returned to our camp at Thunder Ridge after unveiling the towering monstrosity at the heart of Viathan Lake. This malignant and unapproachable tower is polluting the region with hallucinatory poisons, and Marjory is hard at work to find a counteragent. If you are able to collect any samples of the toxic spores, please bring them to Marjory.

I suspect you're already a part of this, as you aren't the type to stand idly by while others suffer. Provided you aren't too busy foiling enemy raids on resources or pruning the offshoots of their tower that are sprouting up across Tyria, Priory Arcanist Dolja here in our camp could use your help investigating a possible krait motive for allying with the Nightmare Court.

Thank you for your continued assistance, my friend.

—Lady Kasmeer Meade"
