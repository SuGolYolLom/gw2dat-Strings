Strange things have been happening in the world beyond Tyria. Things we took for granted about how we understood the systems of the Mists have been shattered, and now Dessa needs help! Words of your heroism have even reached me here in Mistlock Observatory deep within the Mists. If you are up to the challenge, join a party of adventurers and travel to meet me from the portal in Lion's Arch.

Things that we've seen change:
 —Fractal runs only consist of one island now, instead of four!
 —New weapons have been spotted deeper in the fractals.
 —Ascended breathing apparatuses have been discovered!
 —New daily achievements have been added.

Also, I believe I've discovered the path to building a precursor backpack! Come find me in the Fractals of the Mists if you want to know more!

—Kelvei, Legendary Observer of Dessa's Krewe"
