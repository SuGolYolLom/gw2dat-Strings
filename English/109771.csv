We write to you today to express our congratulations! You have successfully charted all of Kessex Hills. When you entered the region, it was but a blank slate, and now you leave it with no stone left unturned. Fantastic! Your persistence is admirable. Through centaurs, krait, bandits, and necrominions, you pressed onward. We urge you to continue your quest.

Gendarran Fields to the northeast offers new challenges. If you are looking for a change of scenery, head due west into the Brisban Wildlands. I'm sure this won't be the last time you hear from us. <br>Congratulations again.
