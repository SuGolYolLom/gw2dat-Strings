We don't know if this has anything to do with the Pact's offensive in Orr, but the situation requires investigation and, if necessary, confrontation. We require infantry to bolster our existing forces and protect our current entrenchment, including the Vigil Megalaser and its power batteries.

Come to Splintered Coast as soon as possible. The Vigil needs you.
