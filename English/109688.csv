"11";"Commander,
What a shame about Crusader Apatia. Don't lose heart: your Wyld Hunt, and mine, still have a long way to go, and I hate the thought of going on without you.
I'm about to meet up with Eir, and possibly Zojja, in yet another attempt to bridge the gap that divides us. I don't see why the others can't simply leave the past alone. Mistakes get made, people die. It's a lesson we all need to learn, and one that I hope you've already accepted.
May the Pale Tree bless you and guide you,

I wanted to thank you for helping us salvage treasure out here. The undead cause trouble wherever they go, and having someone to help deal with them makes a huge difference.
