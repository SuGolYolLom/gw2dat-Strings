I built this homestead for me and my family years ago to prepare for the coming of Zhaitan—an attack that never came. But I built, I reinforced, I toiled anyway, living in fear of...just about everything. But for all my preparation, I couldn't save my family. I lost what I set out to protect. Nothing I can do will bring them back...but at least what I've built can serve some purpose. I hate to admit it, but the White Mantle attacks are almost vindicating.

Come talk to me when those wretched White Mantle aren't around. I've got some goodies hidden in a locked chest underground, and I'd like to give you the key. It's a little dangerous getting down there—I've gotten very skilled at booby-trapping—but I think you'll like what you find.
