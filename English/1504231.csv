Vlast protected these lands, and we're hoping to carry on in his name in whatever way we can. His body may very well hold the key to Ascension, and these slivers will provide us with ammunition for a truly formidable weapon. You've helped us protect ourselves and everyone we are able to save with such an arsenal.

Thank you. I owe you a favor.
