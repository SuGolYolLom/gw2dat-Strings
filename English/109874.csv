You've proven that you can stand up and fight for yourself.

Now it is time for you to show the courage to walk away from my training grounds and into the unknown.

Shadowy creatures have stolen the luminous orbs that Kella needs to light the island, and she needs them returned to her. I'm sure you can handle it. It'll be a good exercise for you!
