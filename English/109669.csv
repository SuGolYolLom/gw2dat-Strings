Glad to hear you're still fighting the good fight with your order. Congratulations on recruiting the grawl. I've had my run-ins with them, like everyone else in Hoelbrak, but I know they'll be valuable allies against the dragons.
Don't dwell on losing the grawl village—homes can be rebuilt. The important thing is that you saved lives and secured their help.
I'm still trying to salvage Destiny's Edge, but it's a long, hard road. I won't give up, however: Tyria still needs heroes, and even I don't expect you to do all that needs doing by yourself. I'll keep trying and let you know if and when they come around.
May the Spirits guide you,

I heard about your work with the grawl—well done. They may be little more than a pack of feral goofballs, but they know how to fight. My people used to skirmish with them every chance we got, and they usually held their own, so it'll be good to have them with us against the dragons.
I'd write off their village as an acceptable loss if I were you. An army needs soldiers: you can worry about homes after the war's been won.
Some of the members of Destiny's Edge are still trying to salvage something out of that fiasco in Lion's Arch, but for now, I'm staying out of it. I'd rather focus on problems that can actually be solved, and don't involve a lot of tiny hairless freaks whining at each other.
Make the Legions proud. I'll be watching.

I've been watching your progress since you left to join your order, and I continue to be impressed. Nice work recruiting the grawl—wild, unruly apes can be a real pain to deal with (remind me to tell you about the one I know named Logan), but it sounds like you handled it with aplomb.
Don't let losing their village weigh you down. If it weren't for you, they wouldn't be alive and so having a home wouldn't matter. At least this way there's enough of them left to rebuild.
I'm about to walk into what could be an exciting new development, but it could also be a total waste of my time. Logan (the aforementioned ape) may be there, as it involves Krytan royalty. I just hope I can keep him from making a drake's breakfast of the entire thing.
Keep up the good work,

As for me, I'm heading to our old friend Caudecus's estate to support Queen Jennah as she meets with the charr ambassador. There's a chance Zojja may be there, but I don't expect a joyful Destiny's Edge reunion. In fact, I'll be lucky if she doesn't punch me in the knees.
