"11";"The latest trend from Elona is sweeping Tyria—roller beetle racing! Whether you're a rolling legend, a rookie racer, or a spectator ready to see the greatest thrills this side of Ascalon, you'll want to check out one of the organized races. Courses have been set in Gendarran Fields, Brisban Wildlands, Mount Maelstrom, Snowden Drifts, and Diessa Plateau. Or if you need to get a feel for riding a beetle, try the test track in Kessex Hills!

The racecourses are a permanent installation, but as a special offer in celebration of their grand opening, daily prizes will be awarded during the first month to racers who complete a rotating selection of race events!

What do you think? I'm workshopping the ad copy a bit. With all the rumors coming out of Elona, I was thinking a bit of sport might be good for morale. It'd be a big boost if a hero like you put in an appearance and maybe set a few track records.
