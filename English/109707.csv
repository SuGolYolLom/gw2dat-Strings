What happened to Apatia was a tragedy, but you cannot let it ruin your resolve. I know something about losing those with whom you go into battle, and I won't let you make the same mistakes I made.
Don't focus on what went wrong. Focus on the fact that you recovered that krait orb. Such magic could turn the tide against Zhaitan, and will ultimately save hundreds if not thousands of lives.
I am still working to heal the rifts that keep Destiny's Edge at each other's throats, but it is slow going. Zojja is especially difficult to reach, so I'm currently focusing my efforts on her. Wish me luck.
May the Spirits continue to guide you to victory,

"100";"Greetings, 

We have not met, but I have long been a follower of your exploits. I am a collector of tales of great daring and heroism, and your name has come up increasingly in the stories that have been reported to me.  I've spoken with  your mentor, and the suggestion was made that I contact you and add your stories to my collection.

Your mentor was a member of an adventuring group known as Destiny's Edge. They were legendary heroes, but went their separate ways about five years ago, for reasons I have yet to discover – none have chosen to share that story with me. If you discover the nature of their separation, I would be most appreciative.

Thank you for your help in this, and I will get in contact with you in the future, and hope to keep you in touch with the whereabouts of your mentor and the other members of Destiny's Edge. 

Through this I will remain,

Your Herald"

What happened to demolitionist Tonn was a tragedy, but you cannot let it ruin your resolve. I know something about losing those with whom you go into battle, and I won't let you make the same mistakes I made.
Don't focus on what went wrong. Focus on the fact that you sank Zhaitan's flagship. That will make the Pact's ultimate victory much, much easier to achieve.
I am still working to heal the rifts that keep Destiny's Edge at each other's throats, but it is slow going. Zojja is especially difficult to reach, so I'm currently focusing my efforts on her. Wish me luck.
May the Spirits continue to guide you to victory,
