As it turns out, you don't need an army to chase away dredge—just you. Now, it's time to uncover the secrets behind this ore. Keep up the good work!

Word is spreading that you're quickly making yourself invaluable to your Order. I'm pleased to see you're having so much success outside Kryta. I've heard that Rytlock and Eir have been investigating the Ascalonean catacombs. Zojja still fights for Snaff's legacy, while Caithe roams the Caledon Forest, keeping her own counsel. Perhaps this whole thing was a mistake. I've spent some time considering what to do about Destiny's Edge, and to be honest, I'm not sure the situation can be salvaged. I made a choice to save Jennah; a choice I don't regret. So long as she needs me, I have to be there for her. 

If you need me, I will be attending a party at Legate Minister Caudecus's estate near Beetletun. The Queen may be in danger from that old spider, and I don't intend to allow him to succeed in stealing her throne.
