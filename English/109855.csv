It's always more fun to explore a new world with others.

Welcome to your world!"

There's strength in numbers, and from what I hear, recruiting these folks could really help to boost the influence of any guild that welcomes them in. Besides, you never know when a new ally might come in handy. With all the recent mayhem—Tequatl going berserk, the Toxic Alliance, and all the Scarlet craziness—I know I'd feel better having as many friends around as possible.
