• Collect the remaining shards of Caladbolg.
• Collect energy from places of power across Tyria.
• Obtain or craft a Vision Crystal to allow you to commune with Caladbolg.
• Obtain or craft a Spiritwood Scion to aid in restoring Caladbolg's physical form.
• Obtain or craft an Orb of Natural Essence to rejuvenate Caladbolg.

If you find yourself in need of guidance, I will remain at your home to provide whatever aid I can.
