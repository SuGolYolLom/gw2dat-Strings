"126";"Greetings!

I am pleased to announce that the Temple of the Silent Storm battleground is finally making its PvP tournament debut! Starting January 28, and for the next seven days, the regular eight-team/three-round paid tournaments will be replaced by two-team/single-round paid tournaments featuring the Temple of the Silent Storm venue.

To participate, open the PvP panel and select "Go to the Heart of the Mists." Once there, you need to create your own five-person paid tournament roster either by speaking with me, or by joining another player's existing roster. Once the roster has five signatures, click "Submit" and the tournament will begin shortly. The entrance fee is three tournament tickets per player. 

Also, at the end of the week, we will be adding the Temple of the Silent Storm to the regular PvP rotation for both free and paid tournaments. 

I hope to see you in the arena!
