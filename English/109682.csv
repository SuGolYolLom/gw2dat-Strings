Don't dwell on losing the skritt scratch—homes can be rebuilt. The important thing is that you saved lives and secured their help.

As for me, I'm heading to our old friend Caudecus's estate to support Queen Jennah as she meets with the charr ambassador. There's a chance Zojja may be there, but I don't expect a joyful Destiny's Edge reunion. In fact, I'll be lucky if she doesn't punch me in the knees.

Keep up the good work,

I heard about your work with the skritt—well done. They may be little more than a pack of twitchy sneak-thieves, but they can be formidable in large numbers, so it'll be good to have them with us against the dragons.
I'd write off their village as an acceptable loss if I were you. An army needs soldiers: you can worry about homes after the war's been won.
Some of the members of Destiny's Edge are still trying to salvage something out of that fiasco in Lion's Arch, but for now, I'm staying out of it. I'd rather focus on problems that can actually be solved, and don't involve a lot of tiny hairless freaks whining at each other.
Make the Legions proud. I'll be watching.

What a shame about Warmaster Caisson's mortar squad. I'm glad you solved the problem and removed the mesmer that caused it.
Don't lose heart: your Wyld Hunt, and mine, still have a long way to go, and I hate the thought of going on without you.
I'm about to meet up with Eir, and possibly Zojja, in yet another attempt to bridge the gap that divides us. I don't see why the others can't simply leave the past alone. Mistakes get made, people die. It's a lesson we all need to learn, and one that I hope you've already accepted.
May the Pale Tree bless you and guide you,
