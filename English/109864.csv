This is a general emergency warning. A few hours ago, a massive flying platform has entered Sanctum Harbor, bringing destruction and spreading a lethal miasma over the city. Furthermore, Aetherblade airships, Molten portals, and Toxic forces are overwhelming the Lionguard response.

Some of the citizenry is still trapped inside the city limits. We are calling on available heroes to assist in the evacuation efforts. 

Lion's Arch needs you. If you can, please report to the forward camps in Gendarran Fields, Bloodtide Coast, and Lornar's Pass at once.

Whether they know it yet or not, they're preparing for an even bigger battle, possibly the biggest in the history of our people. If you're going to stare down a dragon, you'd better have a few allies at your back. We need people like you to join in the fight. Whatever path you're on, I hope you see how important it is that we all unite.
