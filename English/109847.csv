"597";"The magic find stat on all gear has been removed as part of a shift to make magic find an account-wide bonus. There are now only three ways to increase your magic find: various consumable boosts have retained their magic find bonuses, achievements can give permanent bonuses to account-wide magic find, and it can be increased by consuming Essence of Luck, which is salvaged from items with a rarity of fine or masterwork. For more details about these changes, visit https://www.guildwars2.com.

<c=@warning>If you have gear that previously had a magic find stat combination, you will need to double-click it to permanently change its stat combination to something else of your choice. The Celestial stat combination has simply had its magic find removed and does not have this special functionality.</c>"

<c=@warning>If you have transmuted your legendary weapon, you will need to use a Transmutation Splitter to get these awesome updates applied. Here's one on us!</c>"
