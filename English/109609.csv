"337";"Twitchy Jake should still be in prison, but he was at the bandit base. He must have been released almost immediately after his arrest. That's just not right. How deep does the corruption go if they're letting dangerous thugs like Jake walk free?"

"354";"Minister Zamon, a respected and powerful official in Divinity's Reach, is suspected of aiding the bandits. Logan Thackeray needs more evidence before he can accuse Zamon, so a plan has been hatched to collect more information at a dinner party packed with Zamon's peers."
"355";"A Society Function"
"356";"The well needs protection, but the Seraph can handle that. Two-Blade Pete's gang has come to the conclusion that Quinn is a Seraph informant. His life is in danger, and nothing else matters. The gang must not be allowed to kill Quinn."
"357";"The Rescue"

"612";"Seeking the Zalisco"

"614";"The Direct Approach"
"615";"Pellam is right. Attacking the Dengatl only means a greater death toll—on both sides. The sylvari will need allies to defeat the Elder Dragons. With a little trickery, you can get the poison back and leave the door open to diplomacy."
"616";"Trading Trickery"
"617";"The Dengatl sold the poison to a third hylek tribe: the Ogotl. Of all the hylek in Caledon Forest, the Ogotl are the least predictable. They could multiply the effects of the Hazupl poison. Unfortunately, they're also a little insane."
