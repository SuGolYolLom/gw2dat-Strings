The Brandstorm raging outside was a zephyr compared to the storm in Hubert's heart.

The door crashed open, and she who haunted him—she who had once been his lover—burst in.

"The dragon may have crystallized my body," his Elite Branded Sweetheart said. "But you, Hubert...you crystallized my heart."

"Wait, is that a good thing?" Hubert asked. She answered by leaning in. Hard angles met soft flesh in a long, passionate, and surprisingly tender kiss. And Hubert realized that maybe, just maybe, he could love again."

High atop the Labyrinthine Cliffs, our Zephyrite friends have been working in tandem with Lion's Arch to host an incredible variety of fun vendors and events to entertain visitors from all across Tyria. This celebration of unity and peace between our cultures is more important than ever before, and we hope that you will join us in the festivities.

In this spirit of cooperation, Queen Jennah has personally overseen the reopening of the Crown Pavilion, featuring a variety of challenges both new and old for Tyria's finest to test their mettle!

Transportation to the festivities couldn't be easier! Special hot air balloons are now stationed in each nation's capital city. Visitors can also sail directly from the ship from Lion's Arch.

We look forward to seeing you at the festival!

— Captain Ellen Kiel"

I write this knowing it will never reach your eyes. I've been faithfully yours since the moment I entered your service—I have never wavered, and I never will. I tell you this because you may not understand what I'm about to do. I belong to you, yes, but also to the dark god. He has shown me how to end this war. And the price is steep.

I will read this scroll, fully knowing the consequences. Orr will be gone. Perhaps forgotten. But it will not be remembered as a land conquered by brutes. To me, that is worth the sacrifice. I'm sorry, old friend—and I hope one day, when we meet in the afterlife, you will greet me with forgiveness."
