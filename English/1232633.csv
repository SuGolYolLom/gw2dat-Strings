"159";"Upon logging in, you will see that the Skills and Traits section of your Hero panel is now gone. In replacement of this, we have added an entirely new Build tab which allows you to view all of your skills and traits in one convenient location. As well, you will notice in the Build tab that there are three slots with grayed-out backgrounds—these are your Specialization slots.

"What are Specializations?" Instead of choosing traits across varying trait lines, you can now select up to three different Specializations depending on your level. Each Specialization offers a variety of traits for you to choose from, which give you passive abilities that enhance the way you play. By default, you are given access to a base set of Specializations known as Core Specializations, which you can equip by clicking on the left-hand arrow of a Specialization slot.

"Where did my skills go?" Excluding racial skills, all nonweapon (heal, utility, and elite) skills that appear on the right half of your skill bar are now locked inside the new Training tab. To unlock these skills, open up your Hero Panel and go to the Training tab, then select a track under Core Skills or Core Specializations. In order to train, you will need to spend Hero Points (previously Skill Points) in a selected track. Hero Points are earned by leveling up or by completing Hero Challenges (previously Skill Challenges) throughout the world.

"Can I spend my Hero Points on Mystic Forge items?" As part of this change, we are limiting the use of Hero Points to just training skills and traits—you will no longer be able use Hero Points (previously Skill Points) to buy items from Miyani at the Mystic Forge. Miyani now takes a new currency called Spirit Shards. Any excess Skill Points you had previously accumulated have now been converted into Spirit Shards and added to your wallet. Scrolls of Knowledge have also been converted into Spirit Shards. Moving forward, this new currency can be acquired through Daily Achievements, Champion Loot Bags, PvP Reward Tracks, Birthday gifts, and once you hit level 80, from Tomes of Knowledge and regular drops from creatures.
