This is a weird one, so bear with me—I just received a personal invitation for me and "those wonderful adventurers I always seem to be traveling around with" to tour the interior of the Mystic Forge.

THE MYSTIC FORGE! The source of Tyria's most legendary weapons and armor! The Priory's never been granted permission to see how it works, so this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us.

It could ALSO just be a scam. Even though the letter is signed by Zommoros himself, something about this feels fishy to me. I don't know what goes on inside the Mystic Forge, but be ready for anything.
