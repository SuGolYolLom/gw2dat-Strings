If my theories are correct, unlocking Ascension should—no, strike that, WILL—provide the key to Eternal Alchemy.

But enough prattle, nonverbal as it is! I have glyphs to decode!

You've proven yourself—your courage, your loyalty, your determination. We need someone like you to lead a push inside Augury Rock. I doubt Josso Essher will let us stroll in and take the glyphs we need.

You should also take a look at the contract board. We've got our hands full here safeguarding the camp, unearthing ancient secrets, and tracking down Forgotten lore. If you can help out with those bounty contracts, that's one thing we don't have to worry about.

You've already done a lot for us, but the danger out here is not something that can be wiped out overnight. Whatever you can do for us, we're grateful.

Thank you, friend.
