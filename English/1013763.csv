"26";"Your wallet's look and feel have been updated! We've also moved the wallet from your Hero panel to your Inventory, so look there to check out the changes. 
Use the new Wallet button in the lower left of your Inventory to toggle wallet mode on and off. In wallet mode, the top of the wallet has a drop-down list, where you may select from different categories to make it easier to view the desired currency. Currencies are also now in a list format to make the information more compact and allow for easier additions. Finally, while in Inventory view, gold will always be displayed, but the second currency listed at the bottom of the panel will change to display whatever currency is appropriate to the map you currently occupy.
The following items have been converted to currencies:
•Bandit Crests
•Geodes
•Pristine Fractal Relics
•WvW Tournament Tickets
•Spirit Shards (formerly Skill Points)
This conversion is automatic, but you will have to log in with each character to get the items from their inventories deposited into the wallet."
