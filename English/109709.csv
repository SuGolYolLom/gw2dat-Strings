As we discussed, we need to deal with the huge Orrian bone ship that's marauding along the coast of the Mire Sea. I want you to join our demolitions expert, an asura named Tonn. Assist him with his preparations and make sure the bone ship goes down. The Pact needs this victory, both to protect the coastline and to prove to potential allies and new recruits that we can stop the spread of Zhaitan's influence. Good luck.

As we discussed, I'd like you to look into the problems Warmaster Dalia Caisson's artillery unit has been having near Mount Maelstrom. She's experienced a rash of missing personnel, lost supplies, and garbled orders. This is one of our best units and it occupies a key position, so that battery needs to function perfectly. Report to Caisson and see what you can do to help her solve her communication problems.

The Vigil's making surprise attacks against as many of the Molten Alliance's weapon facilities as possible to rescue prisoners and crush the invasion. And they need help.

Join us! I'd be honored to fight by your side once more. Return to Wayfarer Foothills or Diessa Plateau and watch for any indication that they've found an entrance. Bring friends, lots of them! I'll be there, ready to bust some Molten heads. And by Wolf, I'm looking forward to it.

I owe him nothing, but reporting what happened is the right thing to do. Besides, I heard from one of the prisoners that Ottilia might be there.

Rox sends her thanks too. She's taking captured Molten criminals to the Black Citadel Stockades. We've all got separate lives to lead, I know, but Rox says we were thrown together for a reason. She doesn't think this will be the last time we meet. I hope she's right. Maybe I'll see you in Hoelbrak. Oh, and Rox suggests you go to the citadel to help her with the interrogations there. May Wolf guide your steps, my friend.
