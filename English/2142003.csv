>Inquest activity at the Rata Primus installation will be put on hold for the foreseeable future. This is unfortunate, as I was just beginning to determine how my portal technology could be miniaturized for personal use. 

>I backed up some data locally, but Gorrik insisted I create external fail-safe backups. That worked, of course, but it did not help that I had stored them all within Rata Primus itself. So when Rata Primus was overrun by Awakened and we were forced to evacuate, that complicated matters significantly. I am at the very least confident that my encryption algorithm cannot be broken without severely impacting the onboard data.

>And when the time came, I felt it more important to download Gorrik's scarab plague data and everything that existed regarding research into Kralkatorrik. Saving all civilization is perhaps more important than my portal technology. Also, I could probably replicate my findings and do so in a more performant manner starting once again from scratch.

No idea why I'm doing this. Haven't done one of these since...

A long time.

Always was the best way to get my thoughts down, like I'm doing a report for Rytlock or something.

So, Olmakhan.

They split from the charr a long time ago, came down from Ascalon while the Flame Legion was still ruining things up there. Spent a lot of time on the run, learned to do things differently.
First thing I noticed: no fahrars. Cubs are collectively raised by the village, where the cubs learn to hunt and fish, but also to play. They have no warbands because there is no war. The only battle they know is the one against the Inquest and their experiments. They live in harmony with nature.

No fahrars. No warbands. No gladiums. Everyone is part of the tribe. Everyone has their role. Everyone is needed. Everyone is wanted.

It sounds good. Too good, honestly.

Also? I hate that idiom. It sounds cruel, like you're doing it to hurt someone. Being trapped in the dark is never a good thing.

So, let's come up with a new idiom: I was omitting the truth so my friends and colleagues wouldn't worry about me. Because we have to save the world. And saving the world is going to require planning and strategy. And it's harder to plan and even harder to strategize when you're also wondering, "Is Taimi okay now? Should I check on her?"

Okay, that's not really an idiom. But the sentiment's there.

Here's the real problem: I know the commander. I know everyone in Dragon's Watch. Their hearts are too big. They care too much. I need them to care less about me for a little while, just until we fix this. Until we can stop.

Saving the whole world? That's a big mission. Impossibly big. It's hard to fathom the stakes. When push comes to shove, will they be thinking about the whole world, or will they think about me and my condition? When they have to make decisions, strategize, travel places, delve into ruins...will they be thinking about the whole world, or will they be worried whether or not I'm in pain?

I know they'd never sideline me, but I don't want to put them in a spot where they'd...you know...

...have to consider it in the first place."
