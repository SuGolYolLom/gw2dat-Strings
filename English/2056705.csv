2. Nobody crossed the Desolation in a single day. Except Joko.

3. Madness is a poor substitute for magnificence.

4. To know Joko is to praise Joko; to praise Joko is to know Joko.

5. Mercy speaks to a lack of imagination.

6. Before making any major life decision, pause. Ask yourself if it will please Joko. If no is your answer, then you know your answer.

7. All are created equally inferior to Joko.

8. There is nothing in existence so tedious as mediocrity.

9. If you want to be bored, follow a gourd.

10. There is only one Golden Rule. Do unto others in whatever way serves Joko."

I. Foul Fall foretells Winter; Winter worries into Spring;
Spring storms bring summer swelter; and the sweltiest summer brought Joko the King
 
II. No mother could have birthed Him; from no father did he spawn.
Joko the Singular simply sprang to being, as Tyria purred along.
 
III. Joko ended nothingness; Joko started time.
And now Joko, who is bored, sends both meter and rhyme to be tortured and executed.
 
IV. I, Joko, the Eternal Monarch, Scourge of Vabbi, the Beloved,
Most lauded poet, capturing life and torturing it and then capturing its death
 
V. And torturing that too; Poet-King Joko, who has the screams of the tormented
Ringing in his ears daily, for it is Joko who torments,
 
VI. Torments and is tormented by a lack of good help
(Please apply within), hereby inscribes his name
 
VII. And a fraction of his honorable titles, to begin, at last,
His magnum opus, his masterpiece, an exquisite confection—this poem.
 
VIII. The most noble Joko, born beneath a stormy sky.
A student of sand and strife, willed into being by sweet suffering,

IX. Had no mother. No father. The cries for a god were answered,
And the answer was Joko.
 
X. Fully formed, fully realized, he sprang forth,
And those who saw greatness served him.
 
XI. By Joko, this is already tedious. Must I really do this for another hundred stanzas?
My time is eternal, and still I feel like I'm wasting it."

~~-X-~~    Spend some quality time in the Forbidden Vault. It wouldn't do for my harem to feel neglected or forgotten. Note: don't play favorites.

(Ongoing)    Rule it all.

~~—-~~    Track down Koss. Choose an appropriate place to hang him by his ankles. Above Yohlon Bluffs? Perhaps the Mouth of Torment. Five centuries seems too beneficent—seven?

~~—-~~    Deface the Sunspear Sanctuary. Get creative.

~~—>~~ Conscript/Awaken vandals? 

~~-X-~~    Rewrite the history of Arah and the birth of the gods. How to hint that I gave birth to them?
