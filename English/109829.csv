"240";"I'm competing for the open Ship's Council seat. To strengthen my position, I'll be working with Zephyr Sanctum to establish a trade treaty between them and Lion's Arch. With your support, the Zephyrites will see that I represent a community of people who have the sanctum's interests at heart. 

I'll be in Zephyr Sanctum. I hope to see you there.

—Captain Ellen Kiel"
"241";"Greetings.

As the manager and proprietor of the esteemed Black Lion Trading Company, I intend to use my executive knowledge to bring the citizens of Lion's Arch an organized leadership, and to forge a trade agreement with Zephyr Sanctum. Your support helps me blaze trails in this competition. I'll be working with the Zephyrites in their sanctum, and I encourage you to join me. Together, we can show them that Lion's Arch is a worthy business partner.

"242";"Hello to Lion's Arch, and to all my supporters. You're in a league all your own. The Ship's Council has awarded me the seat, and I'm ready to get to the business of making us all a little richer. Here's how.

I'm going to enact the following changes:
- Discounted Black Lion keys for four weeks.
- I'll work with the Fractals to research the fall of Abaddon.
- I'll dig into the secrets behind the Molten Alliance and Aetherblade pirates!
- I'll sponsor a weekly rotation of more Southsun Survival, Sanctum Sprint, Keg Brawl, and Crab Toss games, just to keep things spicy!

—Captain Evon Gnashblade"
"243";"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been given the Ship's Council seat. Your support really turned the tide with the Zephyrites, and the trade agreement I secured impressed the councillors. So, now the real work begins.

I am going to enact the following changes:
- Discounted Waypoint travel for four weeks.
- I will work with the Fractals to research the Thaumanova Reactor explosion.
- I'll launch an investigation into the Molten Alliance and Aetherblade pirates.
- We'll be celebrating with more games of Southsun Survival, Sanctum Sprint, Keg Brawl, and Crab Toss. I'll be establishing a weekly rotation of these games to keep things spicy!

I'm ever grateful.
