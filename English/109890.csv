My airship and I have returned to Divinity's Reach for another year of Wintersday merriment. Prepare yourself, for plethora of holiday happenings await you!

Speak with the Bell Maestro to make happy harmonics in the Bell Choir, or to the Festive Youth to jump into my Winter Wonderland.

You may also converse with the Festive Lionguard near the Divinity's Reach snow globe for some Snowball Mayhem. And for those who desire a challenge, journey through the candy-swirl portal next to me for a test of skill inside my Infinirarium airship.

I've also heard that the local orphanage has suffered the immodest tragedy of having its Wintersday ornaments stolen! The orphans could surely use your help retrieving them.

And then there's the matter of the malfunctioning toys in my workshop. Left unchecked, they could ruin Wintersday! You can enter my ship and reduce the toys to scraps in Toypocalypse by speaking to the Toy Captain near me.

As always, happy holidays,
