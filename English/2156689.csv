"0";"Commander, I've made a breakthrough in my research, and I request your participation! Before my arrival in Bjora Marches, I focused my studies on the norn Spirits of the Wild and the essence they imbued Asgeir Dragonrender and other notable followers with in order to defeat minions of Jormag.

Being here, where Jormag's minions are especially concentrated, has made me realize the need to manipulate that spirit essence for our own use. The Vigil's survival depends on us wiping out the Sons of Svanir, the Aberrant creatures, and the Fallen army. Using my previous research, I developed a system that harnesses malicious spirit essence from Jormag's minions and converts it into virtuous essence to defeat them. In short, my essence manipulation system uses the minions' own power against them!

I think my system would really benefit you as you traverse the wildsâ€”but it will take some training to wield it properly. If you're interested, find me in Jora's Keep!"
