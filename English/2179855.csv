Thank you for your help during the All-Legion Rally.

Blood Legion must start rebuilding the bridge to the Shiverpeaks that Bangar's troops destroyed. I'm looking for volunteers to head back up the mountain pass to see if conditions have improved enough to do so. After seeing in person what you're capable of, I figured I'd reach out to you.

If you're interested, speak to my captain near Shiver Gate. Both Rytlock and I will try to stay in touch if you decide to head back up there.

Best Regards,
Crecia"
