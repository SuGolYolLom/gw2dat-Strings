Glad to hear you're still fighting the good fight with your order. Congratulations on recruiting the ogres. Most rangers I know (myself included) are impressed by their control over their pets, so I know they'll be valuable allies against the dragons.
Don't dwell on losing the ogre kraal—homes can be rebuilt. The important thing is that you saved lives and secured their help.
I'm still trying to salvage Destiny's Edge, but it's a long, hard road. I won't give up, however: Tyria still needs heroes, and even I don't expect you to do all that needs doing by yourself. I'll keep trying and let you know if and when they come around.
May the Spirits guide you,
—Eir"
