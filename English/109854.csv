"42";"Dear %str1%,

I'm dashing off a quick note from our camp on Thunder Ridge in Kessex Hills. Marjory has finally discovered an antitoxin to allow us into the Toxic Alliance's tower in Viathan Lake, and Marjory and I are setting out to learn its secrets. 

I'd feel a lot safer if I knew you were with us. Initial reports suggest that the enemy has an assortment of unique horrors waiting for us inside their tower.

Be safe and well, please.

—Lady Kasmeer Meade

P.S. During her research, Marjory found references to a shattered key that, once reassembled, may grant access to great treasure within the tower. Toxic forces within the tower likely carry parts of this key. If you're unable to recover all the key parts, check to see if Marjory's helper Dee back at camp has any for trade."
