I've received a report that you've done well within the Order. I knew you would. Victory is engineered into your bones, your very blood. It is why we are such good friends. We are very much alike. 

You may have heard that I've intercepted Eir, advancing into the ghost-filled city of Ascalon. Zojja still fights for Snaff's legacy, while Caithe roams the Caledon Forest, keeping her own counsel. As for Logan...the fool's returned to Kryta. To his Queen. The Legions have sent an ambassador to meet with Jennah and work toward the peace treaty. I wish them well, but I cannot pretend that any peace will last, so long as the dragons continue to rise. 

There is more to do, if we are to save the world, and very little time to accomplish our tasks. You will hear from me again. Soon.

—Rytlock"
