Dragon Bash? Dragon? Bash? I'm beside myself with confusion and rage. Do those bilge-swilling simpletons in Lion's Arch think any public amusement featuring dragons is a well-thought out idea? I hear they've decorated with a dragon hologram flying above the city. Isn't that just festive of them? I swear, if it looks like Kralktorrik, I'll devote the rest of my life to ruining that sea-soaked burg for trivializing Snaff's death. Good thing I don't have to step foot in there to smash dragon pinatas, burn effigies, and battle dragon holograms. I hear they're scattering pinatas in the cities and the rest around outside. That's acceptable, but only just.

Why don't you head to Lion's Arch and watch this disaster unfold. It's always good to have a laugh at someone else's idiocy.

No doubt you've heard reports that Lion's Arch is throwing itself a party. Fancy that, a bunch of shady pirates celebrating themselves. Guess they win medals for getting through a day and not spilling their grog. Heard they'll have fireworks too. Ridiculous. Once you see Iron Legion cannons rip into the night, nothing else will do. Pfah! They've already started scattering pinatas inside the major cities, and hologram boxes and effigies around outside. So at least we can celebrate close to home.

Most interesting to me is the Dragon Ball combat arena inside Lion's Arch. Enter and show no mercy, soldier. Given your recent valor on the battlefield, you've earned some leave. Go blow off some steam. Just don't misbehave and end up in the brig. You're a proud member of the Legions, after all.

After working so hard to defend Tyria, we could use some fun. Just in time, the Ship's Council of Lion's Arch is hosting a "Dragon Bash" festival to celebrate our victories—past, present, and future—against the Elder Dragons. I've overheard a few Seraph talking about Dragon Ball, which is a competitive combat arena, and moa race betting. Both should draw quite a crowd in Lion's Arch.

I heard they're having giveaways and plenty of activities to occupy your time and mind. I know they've already placed pinatas inside Divinity's Reach and other cities, and there's hologram boxes and dragon effigies outside. I just hope they don't make too much of a mess.

Bash some dragons for me.

I hear the people of Lion's Arch are hosting a moot, one that features dragons. It's called Dragon Bash, and the city elders are giving visitors a chance to take their fear and rage out on dragon holograms spread across Tyria. If you're itching for a fight, they've built an arena for the ancient game of Dragon Ball. Or you could call on Raven's luck at the moa races. 

I spotted a pinata, a hologram box, and some effigies in the area surrounding Hoelbrak, and I heard the outlying areas around other cities had them too. Nice of them to include us. Head to the center of the festivities in Lion's Arch and revel. We must, once in a while, or we end up with nothing but cold and darkness as our friends. Perhaps I'll see you there.

Have you heard of the peculiar Dragon Bash festival taking place in Lion's Arch? Surely, they can't be celebrating dragons? The details I've gathered are few. The Lion's Arch Ship's Council has put together entertainments and other frivolities both in the city and around the world. I've heard there are fast-running moas you can wager on, and the city's night sky will be painted with fire and light. How exciting! Oh, and they've scattered pinatas in our city and others, and there are hologram boxes and dragon effigies scattered all over outside. They're very thoughtful. I just hope that no drakes eat the gifts and get indigestion.

Of course, I've never understood organized gatherings. Perhaps you might find it interesting. I cannot make it to Lion's Arch to discover what the fuss is about, but you should. You can tell me all about it sometime.

The situation has worsened. One of the Lion's Arch councillors, Theo Ashford, has succumbed to his wounds. The Lionguard is keeping the news quiet while the festival continues, but they're overwhelmed trying to maintain security in the city. At this very moment, a killer walks free, and this cannot be allowed.

Go to Divinity's Reach, to the Eastern Commons.  There, in a back alley bar called the Dead End, you'll find one of the best investigative minds in Tyria, Marjory Delaqua. She will need your help to find those behind the councillor's death. Tell her E sent you. Work with her, sift through the clues, and solve the crime. 

I will surely contact you again,

The Lionguard have tracked down three of the five missing suspects. I'd love to get lost in this mystery, but I must remain in Lion's Arch. I need someone who can travel to interrogate the suspects. I barely know you, but your reputation precedes you. Will you be my legs and ears on the ground? Do what you can to convince these suspects to return to Lion's Arch, and take good notes if they say anything. Here's where you can start:

- We've discovered footprints from the ogre suspect Vorrk leaving the crime scene in Lion's Arch. Follow them.
- Reports indicate that Morraloo, the quaggan suspect, is in Bloodtide Coast in the Sorrowful Sound. Find him.
- The skritt suspect, Kasparak, was sighted in Gendarren Fields near Almuten Estates.

I'll continue the investigation into the whereabouts of our last two suspects. Be wary, trust your instincts, and stay alive.

Inspector Kiel and her Lionguard have tracked down the last two suspects. As with the previous three, I leave it to you to handle the questioning. Here are our leads:

- The kodan suspect, Trembling Song, has been spotted in Snowden Drifts at the Lost Child's Sorrow camp.
- Unsubstantiated rumors place our sylvari suspect, Astorra, hiding out in Caledon Forest in the Rowanwoods.

I've been examining the clues already recovered. The Tassi box uncovered trace elements with magical properties. I'm not sure yet, but my guess is that these components formed a compound that turned the effigy into a deathtrap.  I think our last two suspects hold the final pieces to this puzzle.

Whatever you discover, return to the crime scene in Lion's Arch afterward so we can share our findings.  Be wary, trust your instincts, stay alive.
