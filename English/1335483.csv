Based on the intelligence we gathered after the Spirit Vale operation, we have reason to believe our missing squad leader is being held deeper inside the bandit complex in the northern Maguuma jungle. We don't know what you'll encounter, though we've been hearing reports of strange activity beyond the outer wall. Be prepared for anything.

Assemble your extraction party at the designated mustering point. Good luck.
