Eir and Rytlock are in over their heads. The dredge in Wayfarer Foothills and the Flame Legion in Diessa Plateau have joined forces. Together, they're assaulting the lands north of Hoelbrak and the Black Citadel. Our friends have been overwhelmed by the refugees seeking aid in their cities. I would gladly lend them assistance, but matters in the Grove demand my attention.

I would like you to head to the Imperator's Core in the Black Citadel. The city's tribunes have assembled a defense quorum. Check in with the quorum, and let them know you're there to help. I'm sure what they need most is volunteers to quell their attackers, but Rytlock may have more to add if you speak to him after the assembly. You'll find him in his office. Good luck.

Hoelbrak is still struggling to keep up with the rising number of refugees. Our scouts have confirmed that dredge in Wayfarer Foothills and Flame Legion in Diessa Plateau have allied. Such a partnership cannot be ignored. For now, the best thing we can do is subdue their forces. We need you out there, defending our homesteads and fighting the enemy. With you in the field, Knut and I can plan a large-scale response to the dredge and Flame Legion attacks.
 
They're doing the same over at the Black Citadel and could use your support. They've coordinated a meeting of their high-ranking officials, so check in at the defense quorum in the Imperator's Core, and tell them you're at their disposal. Then, find Rytlock in his office—give him my regards—and let him know you're there to help. He might appreciate the reprieve from his onslaught of tactical meetings.

Rumor's now fact. Dredge in Wayfarer Foothills and Flame Legion in Diessa Plateau have allied. Together, they're attacking our people up north and norn to the west. I'm tied up in meetings with the other tribunes; we're strategizing our return assault. The war council's organized a defense quorum. When you get here, stop by the Imperator's Core and check in.

Listen, my fur's crawling from being holed up with these blockheads, so later, report to my office for a debriefing. And a drink. I could use the break. Afterward, feel free to start pulverizing enemy forces.

Kryta's sources report things have worsened in Hoelbrak and the Black Citadel. Refugees are pouring into the cities from the north, where a dredge-Flame Legion alliance is tearing through Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau. Our comrades are struggling to repel the invaders.

As a Seraph guard, my duties are here. However, I'd like you to assist the cities. The citadel is holding a defense quorum in the Imperator's Core, and they need all the support they can get. Head to the quorum and let the tribunes know you're there to help. But before you leave, stop by Rytlock's office—he may have specific instructions for you.

Masterful sleuthing in Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau has led us to new insights. A dredge and Flame Legion alliance? Talk about unnatural. Not even my craziest conjecture could have predicted that coupling. And when the blind and bullish collide, you can expect acute stupidity to follow.

But I digress—it's evident that the muttonheads in the Black Citadel and Hoelbrak have lost control of the situation. While my presence is essential in Rata Sum, you have the noble opportunity to lend the cities your assistance. Check in at the citadel's Imperator's Core, where their high-ranking officials have organized a defense quorum. Declare your support, then hightail it to Rytlock's office for additional instruction.

However, the invaders are unwavering, accessing weapons caches they've hidden in Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau. And I've just heard they're now taking prisoners. The Vigil needs your help.

It's been rough—turns out the louts are storing weapons caches around Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau, and are now taking prisoners. I want you out there, soldier. Mash 'em up good.

"21";"Addendum"
"22";"I'll make this quick. The Vigil's joined the fight against the dredge and Flame Legion invasion. They're attempting to push back the enemy's forces while preserving homesteaders' lives in Wayfarer Foothills. Through their efforts, we've discovered the invaders have stashed weapons caches all over Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau, and, worse, that they're taking prisoners. Slayer, if there's ever a time you've been needed, it's now.

But their efforts may not be enough. The invaders are well-stocked from the weapons caches they've spread throughout Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau. What's more, they're taking prisoners. Your strength is needed, Valiant. Stop this threat before it destroys our friends.

The Vigil's supplied troops and is attempting to modulate the assailants' numbers, but they've hit an impasse.

They obviously need someone of your caliber and intellect to assist them. So get out there, and redecorate some faces!

A situation in Wayfarer Foothills and Diessa Plateau has come to our attention. The Vigil are responding, and all active Vigil representatives are being deployed—that means you. We've learned about a major military offensive by an alliance of Flame Legion and dredge. Vigil forward scouts have arrived in the area and are leading the response. The invaders have taken innocent Tyrian citizens as prisoners, and that is unacceptable.

Report at your earliest convenience to Tribune Rytlock Brimstone in the Black Citadel. The city has also organized a defense quorum in the Imperator's Core. Check in at the Core and offer your services to the war council. We must confront this invasion with a combined effort and as much force as possible.
