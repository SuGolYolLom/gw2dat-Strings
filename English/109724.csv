There are suspicious locations on all four frequencies, and it's up to you to discover them.<br><br>Try it with the little ghost standing right next to me. She's hiding behind an etheric veil, so use the etheric frequency!<br><br>You'll notice, on your journey, that each page from the Mad King's past contains clues on how to proceed.
