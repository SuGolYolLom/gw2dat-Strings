Our proposal: Develop a civic system of ley line convergence in which each element plays a role in our equitable society. Earth for architecture. Air for energy. Fire for technology. Water for infrastructure.

Pros: Division of labor. Sustainability of resources. Balance. General preservation and modernization of our society.

Cons: An interminable process. Disruption of daily life. Tampering with the ley line could lead to unforseen incidents."

"148";"This precedent was established in the High Court and is set forth due to the discourse of one the finest scholars in Ahdashim. Her treatise, "Life of the Ley Line," has brought new findings to light regarding ley line energy. Specifically, her results prove to be unique to our ley line and ours alone...

Because of this, we feel we must close Ahdashim to the outside world to protect our magic...as evil lurks, and not from afar."
