As you know, Lion's Arch suffered terrible losses in the recent karka attacks. In addition to the loss of life and property, our lighthouse has been destroyed. That lighthouse was a symbol of our great city's history, not to mention an integral part of our daily shipping operations.

We are asking for volunteers to demonstrate the can-do spirit of Lion's Arch and contribute to the rebuilding of our treasured landmark.

I will be personally accepting donations in Lion's Arch. We need weapons, armor, trinkets, wood planks, metal ingots, and food.

On behalf of the city, the Lionguard, and the Captain's Council, I thank you for your generous support.

Responding to the recent karka attacks has left the Lionguard dangerously understaffed. I have therefore been authorized by Captain Magnus on behalf of the Ship's Council to deputize volunteers to assist with the investigation into the cause of the current crisis.
If you are interested, available, and qualified, please meet with me at your earliest convenience.

As you well know, things are at a crucial juncture in regards to the Consortium's Southsun Cove project. Per orders from the Director's Office itself, until we can gauge the full negative impact of the karka attack on Lion's Arch, it is vital that you continue to obfuscate and misdirect any inquiries, especially those from the Lionguard and the Captain's Council.
Remember: we're all in this together, but foul this up and you're going down alone.

I did not care for the tone of your recent request. I need no reminder of my contractual obligations to the Consortium.
As for the requested update: The matter is being pursued by Inspector Kiel of the Lionguard and Researcher Levvi, an asura who hopes to improve her academic credentials. I expect the Lionguard to respond forcefully to the karka attacks, so we should stay out of sight and out of their way until the matter is resolved.
I am withdrawing from Lion's Arch to Garrenhoff until things quiet down. I suggest any and all Consortium employees adopt a similarly low profile.
Do not contact me again. I will send word once I have determined it is safe to resume work on the project.

"30";"This is the sworn statement of Canach, Secondborn.
While under contract to the Consortium, I began preliminary exploration and development of the island later known as Southsun Cove.
During the initial survey, my team located an unknown species of plant. My contract precluded me claiming or profiting from any animal, mineral, or magical resources on the island, but plant life was not mentioned. I therefore ordered my team to collect samples of the plant as they mapped the island and set up an asura gate to facilitate access to Southsun Cove.
I cannot swear to what provoked the karka attack on Lion's Arch, but I expect it was a combination of my team's presence and their activities on the island.
I regret my actions and the harm they have caused. As a show of good faith in the hope of ending the karka threat, I have enclosed a copy of the initial survey map and all accompanying notes.

As I've stated many times, the Pact's victory over Zhaitan would not have been possible without you. I could confer upon you a host of richly deserved official commendations, but I'd rather offer my thanks as a friend and grateful peer. With that in mind, please accept this token—present it to Quartermaster Hargrove and he will offer you the pick of his finest weapons. Whatever you choose, know that it is a symbol of my personal gratitude and esteem. When the Pact next takes the field, I look forward to wielding Caladbolg alongside you and the weapon that commemorates our partnership.

Your friend,
