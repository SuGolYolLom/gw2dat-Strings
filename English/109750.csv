My congratulations and condolences: I received word on the success of your mission and the loss of our demolitions expert. We can discuss the details when you return to Fort Trinity—Zhaitan's forces are planning a major assault on our headquarters, so I need you back here as soon as possible. Until then,
—Marshal Trahearne"
"2";"Commander,
I've read the early dispatches from your mission, and the krait orb is definitely something I want to examine. I'm preparing a team to study and deploy the object—get it and yourself back to Fort Trinity as soon as you can: Zhaitan's forces are planning a major assault on our headquarters, and I want the Pact to be ready. Until then,
—Marshal Trahearne"

I've intercepted reports that you are doing well. Your Order praises you highly. This is for the best. We must unify. We must all unify, or Tyria will blacken and die.

Eir and Rytlock search the catacombs for lost power. Zojja still fights for Snaff's legacy, while Logan falls back to Kryta—and to his Queen. I do not understand why they cannot move forward, why they are so obsessed with the past. How can we make them focus on the future? If they do not, it will soon escape us forever, and the dragons will succeed.

I must follow them. I have to watch, and understand. There is too much at risk for us to fail.

It's become very obvious to me that you're rapidly advancing in your chosen Order. As it should be. You were always the brightest student in your college, you'll do no less well there.

I've heard a most interesting rumor that some of Snaff's technology has been sold in Kryta; to a ridiculous human named Uzolan. He's going to unveil it as his own at some sort of party, at the Legate Minister's estate in Beetletun. I plan to stop him. Of course, this means I'll likely run afoul of that fool Logan, who has gone back to his Queen, but who cares? At least Rytlock and Eir are off in Ascalon, searching for the ghost of some dead king's sword. More power to them on their waste of time.

In any case, I'll see what I find in Kryta, and get back to you. Feel free to meet me there, if you find yourself hoping for a little change of pace.
