You had no obligation to assist the Ebon Vanguard, but when you saw our need, you stood up to help. Thank you for easing the burden on on our city. I hope others follow in your example. If you wish to continue to seek others in need of help, I recommend you speak to Watchman Brikken outside the Hawkgates or Lieutenant Briggins near Forlorn Hope.

"14";"The people of Ebonhawke have known nothing but war for generations. I was born into it. My family pulled iron from the ground so that crafters could use its strength to hammer, to reinforce, to sharpen to a keen edge. As much as we could gather was tossed back into the war. With peace upon us we must find a new use for it, for ourselves. How unexpected that a visitor would show us the importance of being versatile! Iron can rebuild, a soldier can comfort, a traveler can help a city find its feet. From now on, I will try to be as versatile as iron, ready to be shaped to the need. Thank you for showing us this.
