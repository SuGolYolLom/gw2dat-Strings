Mesmers and other concerned parties have been investigating an anomaly in Kessex Hills, where something huge and unpleasant is being cloaked from view. We know it's there, because invisible walls are blocking access to the center of Viathan Lake. 

Kasmeer is going to attempt a spell that will hopefully lift the veil, and your experience in battle could prove invaluable to us here. 

Sergeant Walters of the Seraph is heading south from Fort Salma to stand with us against whatever horrors are revealed by Kasmeer's spell. Please join her, and feel free to bring friends.
