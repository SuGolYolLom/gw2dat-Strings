(waypoint recalibration device) worked like a champion! I've been monitoring the waypoint network, and as the workers repair the waypoints, the vines aren't attacking again. So...did I mention I'm a genius?

Now for the bad news. It's Phlunt. No surprise there, huh? He INSISTS that I give him a personal demonstration of how the W.R.D. works. It's as if he doesn't believe that my device is actually causing the change. I'm afraid he's going to try to weasel out of coming to the summit. Can you come be my backup?

I hope this finds you well. 

I'm afraid my efforts to get the queen to the summit haven't gone as smoothly as expected. The queen has had a situation arise that may prevent her from attending. I'll give you the full details when you arrive, but the short version is that someone is spreading rumors that Queen Jennah not only met with evil Scarlet prior to the Queen's Jubilee celebration, but also conspired to give Scarlet the mechanical watchknights. This is, of course, ridiculous. But the queen can't leave Divinity's Reach until these rumors are squelched. 

Countess Anise has suggested that I use my intuitive ability to find the cad spreading the rumors and discredit them. But, I don't want to do this alone. Will you come help me?
