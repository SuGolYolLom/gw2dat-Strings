It seems the skritt have found something important, but it's so hard to get them to be clear about anything. All we have is "big," "dragons," and "dwarves." Who knows what that means? I'm sure we'll find out, though. See you there!

Whatever's going on underground, it can't be good if creatures with brains the size of walnuts are afraid. Meet me there, and be sure to bring your weapons and your patience.

Can I count on you?
