I have troubling news from the Maguuma. Our enemy is entrenched deep within Forsaken Thicket, and from all of my observations, it looks like they're preparing for something. We need to strike now before they have a chance to recover from their defeat at Salvation Pass.

Meet me at the designated location as soon as possible.
