What happened to your soldiers in the mortar company was a tragedy, but you cannot let it ruin your resolve. I know something about losing those with whom you go into battle, and I won't let you make the same mistakes I made.
Don't focus on what went wrong. Focus on the fact that you uprooted the mesmer who caused the tragedy and in doing so, saved many more lives.
I am still working to heal the rifts that keep Destiny's Edge at each other's throats, but it is slow going. Zojja is especially difficult to reach, so I'm currently focusing my efforts on her. Wish me luck.
May the Spirits continue to guide you to victory,
