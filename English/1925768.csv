RE: NEW QUARANTINE POLICY

Dear Valued Coworkers,

As you might know, Rata Primus has recently acquired a sample of REDACTED during our latest excursion into REDACTED. As this is a particularly virulent REDACTED with a history of spreading uncontrollably, Rata Primus Security has instituted a series of changes to our standard quarantine protocols.

Due to the sensitive nature of REDACTED, R.P.L.'s Golemancy Division has commenced construction on a new fleet of golems to handle all future security and quarantine protocols. 

When you see one, do not say hello or attempt polite conversation. They will only respond to a certified R.P.L. Security Officer.

And remember: we care!"

RE: Let's get inspired!

Many of you attended the quarterly address by our illustrious director. For those who missed it, I recommend a holographic viewing; it covered important ground regarding workplace culture. In short, his message was that grand plans and world-changing ambitions aren't only about glory. We should all reflect on important virtues that are too often overlooked: hard work, personal sacrifice, and humility.

Please note that this message does not imply any reduced emphasis on productivity or outcomes. Researchers unable to produce results in the lab will continue to be subject to the usual hierarchy of punitive actions.

Have a productive quarter!"
