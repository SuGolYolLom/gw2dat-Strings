I've been putting a lot of thought into what happened. It's been hard adjusting to life without Rose. Reading her journal gave me closure, and I can't thank you enough for what you did. 

Without you, I would have gone looking for her and then suffered her same fate. As a token of my gratitude, I ask that you accept this gift. You are a driving force for change in this world. I hope the research in this book helps you and those around you to better understand Orr and its inhabitants. 

No one else should have to get hurt in the pursuit of this information. I know you wanted me to have it, but the words will always be with me, as will Rose. That is enough for me.
