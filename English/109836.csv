"4";"You and your krewe are prepared to extract Doxa from the MIG, but it won't be easy...or safe. So many things could go wrong: Doxa could die, the MIG could run amok again, or the Inquest could storm in and ruin everything. Still, if geniuses avoided conducting experiments that could blow up in their faces, there'd never be any progress. Onward!"
"5";"You and your krewe have decided to fuse Kazz with another golem so that he and Doxa can be together. It's an old story: boy meets girl, girl gets fused to a golem, boy fuses himself to a golem...and as long as Kazz and Doxa don't die, and the golems don't run amok, and the Inquest doesn't spoil everything, this tale might just have a happy ending."
"6";"Securing the second piece of the relic was easy enough, thanks to the VOED, Zojja, and some quick thinking on your part. Now to beat the Inquest to the next piece..."
"7";"You're determined the mystery relic detected by the VOED has three pieces. Your krewe has two, the Inquest has the other—and since they extorted it from you in the first place, it's only fair you should steal it back. The plan is to hit the Inquest caravan while the treasure is in transit. That'll teach them to mess with your krewe!"
"8";"You've determined that the mystery relic has three pieces, and your krewe has acquired two. Now to steal back the first piece that the Inquest extorted from you. Nothing like a little counter-espionage to keep those villains in their place!"
"9";"The mystery relic turned out to be a key that opens Gadd's laboratory—Gadd, one of the most famous and impressive geniuses that ever lived. All that remains is for you to access Gadd's lab, search the place, and claim whatever treasures lie inside."
"10";"Getting in to Gadd's lab wasn't easy, but the artifact you discovered there ought to be worth it. Time to get Gadd's last treasure back to your lab and determine just how valuable it is."
