"64";"Congratulations on defeating King Adelbern and foiling his plot to send his ghost army to Tyria's surface. Unfortunately, it appears that there were more than angry spirits lurking in the catacombs. 

It turns out that Adelbern and his ghostly minions were keeping darker things at bay in those ruined tombs. With Adelbern defeated, monsters are now rising to the surface and endangering a Durmand Priory camp located inside the catacombs.

I thought that you of all people would be interested in returning to the site of your previous triumph and setting matters right!

As always,

Your Herald"

You've helped solve some of Tyria's greatest mysteries. I wonder if you can discover what's disrupting the natural order (such as it is) in Kessex Hills. Some interested parties are gathering on the northern shore of Viathan Lake to investigate, and I feel it may be worth your attention in the near future.

I will surely contact you again,

My sensors indicate you have successfully acquired a living candy-corn elemental. This is fantastic news for our joint effort. Return to me at the Nolani Ruins near the Black Citadel, and be sure to bring your elemental with you. With your elemental and my new prototype candy-energy rifle, we can seal the reliquary and prevent the Bloody Prince from waging his violent campaign on our plane of existence.

The world is cold, and quiet. The chill in my heart feels as though I stand at the heart of winter, even if I know it is not so. I feel truly alone...save for you. I hear that you have done well and struck a mighty blow against Zhaitan. I also hear that, along with the firstborn Trahearne, you have at last begun the true battle—the invasion of Orr.

Rumors of my companions abound. Rytlock and Logan travel north, toward the Citadel of Flame. Zojja chases after Snaff's legacy, never realizing that it is more than golems and crystals. She is in danger. I spoke to Eir at length and managed to convince her that we must go to aid our old friend—but my purpose no longer seems as clear. Not anymore. Why save the world, when everything in it is falling apart?

I hear of your victories, and I am reminded—perhaps there is still a reason for hope.
We will meet again, soon.
