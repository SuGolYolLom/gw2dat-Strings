"38";"Calling All Stalwarts:

We've got trouble on Southsun Cove again. Tensions between the resettled refugees and their Consortium hosts are about to boil over, and the local wildlife is more aggressive than ever. On Captain Magnus' orders, I am deputizing any and all qualified volunteers to help me keep the peace. If you're up for a challenge and you have the skills, come see me so we can shut down this unrest before it gets unmanageable.

The Lionguard has identified the person behind the recent animal attacks on Southsun Cove, but we need help bringing in the culprit. Our target is Canach, a secondborn sylvari with a history of stirring up trouble on Southsun Cove. Canach is already a wanted fugitive, but this latest round of mayhem has pushed him to the top of our most wanted list. Report to Southsun Cove if you're interested in helping me bring him to justice.

In a misguided effort to help people, Canach made the local wildlife a danger to every settler, tourist, and Consortium employee on the island. The Lionguard needs as many brave souls as it can muster to defend the lives of Southsun Cove's residents. If you've got the nerve and the skills, join us in showing Canach how real heroes help people.
