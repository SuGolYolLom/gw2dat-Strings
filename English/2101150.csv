The skyscale's gone. I was vaguely distracted by my research and looked away for the BRIEFEST moment and she's just...gone. Fortunately, I implanted a tracking device in her leg, but time is not on our side. Please return to Sun's Refuge so we can enact a plan.

Respectfully yours,

Gorrik

P.S. Please don't tell Taimi."
