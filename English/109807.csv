We need to stop this problem before it spreads any farther. Warden Lochlain is coordinating the response, so if you can help, report to him and join his stand against the karka.

It's focused on Garrenhoff, and we need to keep it contained there. If you can lend a hand, report to Garrenhoff as soon as you possible. And be careful: the local wizard's tower is involved in some strange occurrences of its own.
Good luck,

"54";"Hello there,
I'm sorry Zommoros wasn't more forthcoming...his ego sometimes gets the best of him. We both appreciate that you're trying to protect our home, so I wanted to share as much information as I could.
The quaggans from Moorookoo Village fled to safer waters in the Caledon Forest, near the tengu stronghold. They may have experience with the karka that could help you.
There's also a hylek alchemist named Gukumatz north of the Michoan Marsh. He's an expert in potions, poisons, and caustic substances, so he may know one that's effective against karka.
The largos is a problem. I've heard one prowls the southern portion of Viathan Lake, so you should start there...just be very, very careful. They don't routinely socialize with other races, but they do like to test themselves, so you may be in for a fight.
I hope this helps. On behalf of myself and the Mighty Zommoros, good luck.
