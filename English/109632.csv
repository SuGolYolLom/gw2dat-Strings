Thanks!

With ambition like that, I doubt this will be the last I hear of you. It made me proud to have played even a small part in your story.

While you were fighting the Darkhoof centaurs, I had some time to read some of the scrolls that have been recovered from their camps. There are some alarming insights on their heirarchy. I'll have to give this further study. 
Thank you for making Scholar's Cleft a safer place for me and my brethren to work.

I was concerned about how our troops would fare when so cut off from the other Seraph, but it seems they got all the help they needed from you. I can stand tall knowing that our mission here has a chance. 

Thank you.
