DO NOT TOUCH

To all the ones I've hated the most: Why couldn't you have been worthier?

First there was Zuri. We were seventeen. I admit that I fumbled a bit and was regrettably unsure of myself back then. But I was young; and youth should excuse a bit, don't you think? I was so very offended by his audacity that I was not my best. The imbecile had the nerve to challenge me for the premiere place by the side of my necromancy teacher. It was before I became a lich, back when I thought another might have something to teach me. ME! Ah, the naïveté of youth, to think one could ever be my better at death, undeath, or, well, anything for that matter. But I digress...

Zuri was surprised when I stabbed him in the back. Literally.

In retrospect, he wasn't worth the bloodstains on my clothes.

There was Thorn. Living so long, sometimes it is nice to come across those who knew me back when. I had hoped he'd matured in death. Instead, it was more of the same. The minute he opened his gourd, I remembered that I find the fool to be an actual waste of my eternal time. And he's so needy. It's always the same story with him—beheadings that do nothing to shore up his power and jokes. Again with the awful jokes! He starts to laugh at them before you can even groan and judge.

I will give him one thing though: as horrid as he looks in orange, the pumpkin head is a vast improvement on the face he was born with.

If they're not needy, they're obsessed. Like that renegade "warmarshal" Turai Ossa. He just keeps coming around, nipping at my heels. I suppose his tenacity might say something about his staying power, but it's really not cute.

I know that I am the Eternal Palawa Joko, the All-Powerful. They will never meet my like. I see why they want me as an archrival. They can never hope to have a more glorious death than at my hands. But I am frankly far, far out of their leagues. Have some pride! I'm just looking to scratch an itch here. I don't need a forever-nemesis.

Or maybe I do...

Is it too much to ask for a worthy adversary? One with stamina and a quick mind, one who might even surprise me now and again?"
"46";"Recipe[s]: Sigil of Hobbling"
"47";"[lbracket]Much of the page is charred, as if it were rescued from a fire.[rbracket]

...the most special evening I have ever experienced—to gaze into your eyes, the twilight reflected, an eternity contained. There can be no other for me. I have lived and died every moment waiting for the gift of your everlasting companionship. That you would entertain my overtures though I have no titles, lands, nor family name to lay at your feet—I am overcome. [lbracket]Ed. Note: Scale back on the allusions to my generosity.[rbracket] I have not the words to express the fullness in my heart.

Oh, great Joko, my existence is but to long for you... Every breath I take is but to beg for your attentions. I know that I cannot mean the world to you as you mean it to me. Yet, if I might even inhabit one flickering thought of your great mind, my very life would have achieved its pinnacle. [lbracket]Ed. Note: You use "great" as a qualifier twice. Is that the extent of your vocabulary?[rbracket]

Without the blessing of your presence, the sun, the sands, the warm caress of the breeze hold no appeal. I forget to eat while thinking of you; I cannot sleep—dreams of you are more fleeting than waking contemplations of your mellifluent voice, your soaring intellect, your ascendant countenance...

[lbracket]Editor's Note: I was assured that you were the premiere bard, the preeminent troubadour in all of Elona, worthy of this commission. Have a care. Those who disappoint Joko tend to burn in the flames of their failures.[rbracket]"

DO NOT TOUCH

Dear Diary,

Allow me to catch you up: Everyone in Kryta is an idiot and I hate it here.

There's a twit of a princeling who can't seem to stop pulling the wings off of flies. Over and over—does he expect a different result? I'm sure he was dropped on his overly round head as a babe. Repeatedly.

It's not as if the flies that survive have the capacity to spread rumors about his cruelty. What could possibly be the point of going back to that well? So shortsighted. So wasteful. So UNINSPIRED.

Today, in the spirit of magnanimity, I pointed out a few creatures that might survive torture and be of use afterward. The coddled simpleton is surrounded by servants, ready to suffer and to even thank him for the attentions.

To my utter horror he responded by engaging me in a contest of puns. It was atrocious and I couldn't extricate myself quickly enough for comfort.

(...I may have actually met him in battle for several volleys. But that's between you and me. It's so boring here!)

I will be overjoyed when this ordeal of Mother's diplomatic tours comes to an end.

Yours,

Iggy"
