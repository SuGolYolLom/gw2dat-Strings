Looks like the lighthouse you sabotaged is about to pay off! A Dead Ship has been sighted off the northern shore of orr, following the light from Beacon Torch. Orders are to rendezvous and be ready to board that ship when it runs aground. The squad's meting with Fel Vaerdenmer, one of the Pact's best captains. He'll brief you when you arrive.

While it may be exciting to take an unguided jaunt to an open-ended adventure, we are compelled to put our citizens' and visitors' safety first. Any questions, complaints, or legal claims that result from use of this asura gate should be taken directly to the Consortium. 
If you decide to use this gate, the Council encourages you to be safe, have fun, and not die.
