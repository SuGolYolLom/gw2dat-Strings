Internal Security Directorate

COMPLAINT: Krewe chief reports disappearance of researcher (Subject A).

INVESTIGATION: Masticated and digested remains of Subject A discovered in specimen enclosure. Tranquilizer dart discovered among remains. Suggests unnatural death.

Interview with fellow researcher (Subject B) indicates motive and results in admission of guilt. Subject A apparently took credit for Subject B's work and had the gall to smirk at him while doing so.

FINDINGS: Subject B's actions, while not recommended, were found to be justifiable."
