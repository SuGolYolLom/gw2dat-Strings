The conflict in the Crystal Desert is bleeding over into central Tyria, with refugees pouring into Lion's Arch every day. Queen Jennah has already dispatched a diplomatic team from Divinity's Reach. You and I have some common interests in play. I'd like to discuss them in private—I think we can help each other.

Meet me at my office as soon as you can.

—Captain Ellen Kiel"
