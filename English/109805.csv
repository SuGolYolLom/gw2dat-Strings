Talk to Magister Tassi by the lion statue in Lion's Arch to get started. Some folks have reported that she has a ghostly companion helping her test a device that she'll mail to you.

Are you craving some candy corn? Who could blame you? Head out into the world beyond Lion's Arch to find special candy corn nodes that you can mine for all the yummy goodness you'll need to craft spookilicious recipes and fuel Magister Tassi's psychomagical device.

Halloween doesn't just happen in Lion's Arch either. You'll find that the Durmand Priory is active across the world. The Priory has heard reports of terrifying creatures coming through strange doors in Queensdale, Kessex Hills, and Gendarran Fields. You'd better get your adventuring boots on, because you can't hide in Lion's Arch forever! Also, watch for pumpkins to carve as you roam the world!
