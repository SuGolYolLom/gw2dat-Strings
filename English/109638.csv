I wanted to let you know how invaluable your help at Irondock proved to be. Thanks to you, we were able to continue our work on the experimental weaponry we are testing there. Without you, there is no doubt that this program would have suffered a tremendous setback. I believe that the new equipment and machinery that is being tested at Irondock will eventually be the secret to finally vanquishing all the legions' foes. And when that day comes, your name will be included among the list of brave soldiers who made such a victory possible.

"22";"Because of your heroic efforts aiding our soldiers in their struggle against the Separatists, I feel that we may finally be turning the tide in this ongoing conflict. It seems at times as if our ongoing battles with the Human Separatists, the Flame Legion, and the Elder Dragons show no signs of ending. But I believe that we will, in time, emerge victorious. In addition, you should feel pride in the fact that your help has undoubtedly resulted in many charr lives being saved. Both those held captive by the Separatists, and those who will continue the fight against a now weakened enemy. 

Thank you again.

I just wanted to thank you for your help with the arena. The soldiers need training to keep their skills sharp, and they've gotten their fill fighting the minotaurs and drakes you captured. Well done.

Besides, it's a place I've never been and people I haven't met, so I'm really looking forward to it. See you there!
