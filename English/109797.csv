I'm writing to inform you of our progress toward the eventual reclamation of the dredge's home in Bloodtide Coast. Your work disabling their rogue devices and clearing undead out of their caverns will surely allow us to imminently repatriate the dredge.

You'll be glad to hear that we are coming ever closer to reclaiming the territory the skritt lost to the undead.
