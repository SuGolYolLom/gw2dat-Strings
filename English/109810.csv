After touring the cities of Tyria, Tixx the Toymaker and his Funwerks Krewe have finally arrived in Lion's Arch! Festivities are in full-swing, with wassailing and singing, and even bell ringing. But much is astir in Tixx's airship. Now overrun with malfunctioning toys, a Seraph guard is recruiting adventurers to cull the hordes and secure the aerial lab.

But the excitement won't last forever—Tixx is only in Lion's Arch for two weeks, and once he leaves his airship and toys go with him. So don't be a lollygagger! Make sure to stop by the Grand Piazza, where Tixx has a special gift just for you (one that, we've been assured, won't talk back).
