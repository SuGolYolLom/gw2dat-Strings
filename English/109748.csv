The Sentinels and I would like to thank you once again for your recent help with our little ghosts and Branded problem. This ongoing fight really wears down the morale here and your assistance was a much needed shot in the arm.

Although, I'm sure the ghosts and the Branded don't miss you, we would like to see you return some day. Just to say "hello." And maybe stir up a little more trouble for our dead and rotting friends while you're here.
